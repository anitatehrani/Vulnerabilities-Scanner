This is similar to the existing CA     constraints but doesn't require that the CA certificate     is locally installed, for instance, intermediate CA     certificates received from the peers. Wildcard identity     matching (e.g. ..., OU=Research, CN=*) could also be     used for the latter but requires trust in the     intermediate CAs to only issue certificates with     legitimate subject DNs (e.g. the 'Sales' CA must not     issue certificates with OU=Research). With the new     constraint that's not necessary as long as a path length     basic constraint (--pathlen for pki --issue) prevents     intermediate CAs from issuing further intermediate CAs.\n\n  - Intermediate CA certificates may now be sent in     hash-and-URL encoding by configuring a base URL for the     parent CA (#3234, swanctl\/rw-hash-and-url-multi-level).\n\n  - Implemented NIST SP-800-90A Deterministic Random Bit     Generator (DRBG) based on AES-CTR and SHA2-HMAC modes.\n    Currently used by the gmp and ntru plugins.\n\n  - Random nonces sent in an OCSP requests are now expected     in the corresponding OCSP responses.\n\n  - The kernel-netlink plugin now ignores deprecated IPv6     addresses for MOBIKE. Whether temporary or permanent     IPv6 addresses are included now depends on the     charon.prefer_temporary_addrs setting (#3192).\n\n  - Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are configured via     PF_KEY if supported by the kernel.\n\n  - The PF_KEY socket's receive buffer in the kernel-pfkey     plugin is now cleared before sending requests, as many     of the messages sent by the kernel are sent as     broadcasts to all PF_KEY sockets. This is an issue if an     external tool is used to manage SAs\/policies unrelated     to IPsec (#3225).\n\n  - The vici plugin now uses unique section names for     CHILD_SAs in child-updown events (7c74ce9190).\n\n  - For individually deleted CHILD_SAs (in particular for     IKEv1) the vici child-updown event now includes more     information about the CHILD_SAs such as traffic     statistics (#3198).\n\n  - Custom loggers are correctly re-registered if log levels     are changed via stroke loglevel (#3182).\n\n  - Avoid lockups during startup on low entropy systems when     using OpenSSL 1.1.1 (095a2c2eac).\n\n  - Instead of failing later when setting a key, creating     HMACs via openssl plugin now fails instantly if the     underlying hash algorithm isn't supported (e.g. MD5 in     FIPS-mode) so fallbacks to other plugins work properly     (#3284).\n\n  - Exponents of RSA keys read from TPM 2.0 via SAPI are     correctly converted (8ee1242f1438).\n\n  - Routing table IDs > 255 are supported for custom routes     on Linux.\n\n  - To avoid races, the check for hardware offloading     support in the kernel-netlink plugin is performed during     initialization of the plugin (a605452c03).\n\n  - The D-Bus config file for charon-nm is now installed in     $(datadir)\/dbus-1\/system.d instead of     $(sysconfdir)\/dbus-1\/system.d, which is intended for     sysadmin overrides. INVALID_MAJOR_VERSION notifies are     now correctly sent in messages of the same exchange type     and with the same message ID as the request.\n\n  - IKEv2 SAs are now immediately destroyed when sending or     receiving INVALID_SYNTAX notifies in authenticated     messages.\n\n  - For developers working from the repository the configure     script now aborts if GNU gperf is not found.\n\nVersion 5.8.1\n\n  - RDNs in DNs of X.509 certificates can now optionally be     matched less strict. The global strongswan.conf option     charon.rdn_matching takes two alternative values that     cause the matching algorithm to either ignore the order     of matched RDNs (reordered) or additionally (relaxed)     accept DNs that contain more RDNs than configured     (unmatched RDNs are treated like wildcard matches).\n\n  - The updown plugin now passes the same interface to the     script that is also used for the automatically installed     routes, that is, the interface over which the peer is     reached instead of the interface on which the local     address is found (#3095).\n\n  - TPM 2.0 contexts are now protected by a mutex to prevent     issues if multiple IKE_SAs use the same private key     concurrently (4b25885025).\n\n  - Do a rekey check after the third QM message was received     (#3060).\n\n  - If available, explicit_bzero() is now used as memwipe()     instead of our own implementation.\n\n  - An .editorconfig file has been added, mainly so Github     shows files with proper indentation (68346b6962).\n\n  - The internal certificate of the load-tester plugin has     been modified so it can again be used as end-entity cert     with 5.6.3 and later (#3139).\n\n  - The maximum data length of received COOKIE notifies (64     bytes) is now enforced (#3160).\n\nVersion 5.8.0\n\n  - The systemd service units have been renamed. The modern     unit, which was called strongswan-swanctl, is now called     strongswan (the previous name is configured as alias in     the unit, for which a symlink is created when the unit     is enabled). The legacy unit is now called     strongswan-starter.\n\n  - Support for XFRM interfaces (available since Linux 4.19)     has been added, which are intended to replace VTI     devices (they are similar but offer several advantages,     for instance, they are not bound to an address or     address family).\n\n  - IPsec SAs and policies are associated with such     interfaces via interface IDs that can be configured in     swanctl.conf (dynamic IDs may optionally be allocated     for each SA and even direction). It's possible to use     separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic (or     only use an interface in one direction and regular     policies in the other).\n\n  - Interfaces may be created dynamically via updown\/vici     scripts, or statically before or after establishing the     SAs. Routes must be added manually as needed (the daemon     will not install any routes for outbound policies with     an interface ID).\n\n  - When moving XFRM interfaces to other network namespaces     they retain access to the SAs and policies installed in     the original namespace, which allows providing IPsec     tunnels for processes in other network namespaces     without giving them access to the IPsec keys or IKE     credentials. More information can be found on the page     about route-based VPNs.\n\n  - Initiation of childless IKE_SAs is supported (RFC 6023).\n    If enabled and supported by the responder, no CHILD_SA     is established during IKE_AUTH. Instead, all CHILD_SAs     are created with CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges. This allows     using a separate DH exchange even for the first     CHILD_SA, which is otherwise created during IKE_AUTH     with keys derived from the IKE_SA's key material.\n\n  - The swanctl --initiate command may be used to initiate     only the IKE_SA via --ike option if --child is omitted     and the peer supports this extension.\n\n  - The NetworkManager backend and plugin support IPv6.\n\n  - The new wolfssl plugin is a wrapper around the wolfSSL     crypto library. Thanks to Sean Parkinson of wolfSSL Inc.\n    for the initial patch.\n\n  - IKE SPIs may optionally be labeled via the     charon.spi_mask|label options in strongswan.conf. This     feature was extracted from charon-tkm, however, now     applies the mask\/label in network order.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 when built     with OpenSSL 1.1.0.\n\n  - The PB-TNC finite state machine according to section 3.2     of RFC 5793 was not correctly implemented when sending     either a CRETRY or SRETRY batch. These batches can only     be sent in the 'Decided' state and a CRETRY batch can     immediately carry all messages usually transported by a     CDATA batch. It is currently not possible to send a     SRETRY batch since full-duplex mode for PT-TLS transport     is not supported.\n\n  - Instead of marking IPv6 virtual IPs as deprecated, the     kernel-netlink plugin now uses address labels to avoid     that such addresses are used for non-VPN traffic     (00a953d090).\n\n  - The agent plugin now creates sockets to the     ssh\/gpg-agent dynamically and does not keep them open,     which otherwise might prevent the agent from getting     terminated.\n\n  - To avoid broadcast loops the forecast plugin now only     reinjects packets that are marked or received from the     configured interface.\n\n  - UTF-8 encoded passwords are supported via EAP-MSCHAPv2,     which internally uses an UTF-16LE encoding to calculate     the NT hash (#3014).\n\n  - Properly delete temporary drop policies (used when     updating IP addresses of SAs) if manual priorities are     used, which was broken since 5.6.2 (8e31d65730).\n\n  - Avoid overwriting start_action when parsing the     inactivity timeout in the vici plugin (#2954).\n\n  - Fixed the automatic termination of reloaded vici     connections with start_action=start, which was broken     since 5.6.3 (71b22c250f).\n\n  - The lookup for shared secrets for IKEv1 SAs via sql     plugin should now work better (6ec9f68f32).\n\n  - Fixed a race condition in the trap manager between     installation and removal of a policy (69cbe2ca3f).\n\n  - The IPsec stack detection and module loading in starter     has been removed (it wasn't enforced anyway and loading     modules doesn't seem necessary, also KLIPS hasn't been     supported for a long time and PF_KEY will eventually be     removed from the Linux kernel, ba817d2917).\n\n  - Several IKEv2 protocol details are now handled more     strictly: Unrequested virtual IPs are ignored, CFG_REPLY     payloads are ignored if no CFG_REQUEST payloads were     sent, a USE TRANSPORT_MODE notify received from the     responder is checked against the local configuration.\n\n  - The keys and certificates used by the scenarios in the     testing environment are now generated dynamically.\n    Running the testing\/scripts\/build-certs script after     creating the base and root images uses the pki utility     installed in the latter to create the keys and     certificates for all the CAs and in some cases for     individual scenarios. These credentials are stored in     the source tree, not the image, so this has to be called     only once even if the images are later rebuilt. The     script automatically (re-)rebuilds the guest images as     that generates fresh CRLs and signs the DNS zones. The     only keys\/certificates currently not generated are the     very large ones used by the ikev2\/rw-eap-tls-fragments     scenario.\n\nVersion 5.7.2\n\n  - For RSA with PSS padding, the TPM 2.0 specification     mandates the maximum salt length (as defined by the     length of the key and hash). However, if the TPM is     FIPS-168-4 compliant, the salt length equals the hash     length. This is assumed for FIPS-140-2 compliant TPMs,     but if that's not the case, it might be necessary to     manually enable charon.plugins.tpm.fips_186_4 if the TPM     doesn't use the maximum salt length.\n\n  - Directories for credentials loaded by swanctl are now     accessed relative to the loaded swanctl.conf file, in     particular, when loading it from a custom location via\n    --file argument.\n\n  - The base directory, which is used if no custom location     for swanctl.conf is specified, is now also configurable     at runtime via SWANCTL_DIR environment variable.\n\n  - If RADIUS Accounting is enabled, the eap-radius plugin     will add the session ID (Acct-Session-Id) to     Access-Request messages, which e.g. simplifies     associating database entries for IP leases and     accounting with sessions (the session ID does not change     when IKE_SAs are rekeyed, #2853).\n\n  - All IP addresses assigned by a RADIUS server are     included in Accounting-Stop messages even if the client     did not claim them, allowing to release them early in     case of connection errors (#2856).\n\n  - Selectors installed on transport mode SAs by the     kernel-netlink plugin are now updated if an IP address     changes (e.g. via MOBIKE) and it was part of the     selectors.\n\n  - No deletes are sent anymore when a rekeyed CHILD_SA     expires (#2815).\n\n  - The bypass-lan plugin now tracks interfaces to handle     subnets that move from one interface to another and     properly update associated routes (#2820).\n\n  - Only valid and expected inbound IKEv2 messages are used     to update the timestamp of the last received message     (previously, retransmits also triggered an update).\n\n  - IKEv2 requests from responders are now ignored until the     IKE_SA is fully established (e.g. if a DPD request from     the peer arrives before the IKE_AUTH response does,     46bea1add9). Delayed IKE_SA_INIT responses with COOKIE     notifies we already recevied are ignored, they caused     another reset of the IKE_SA previously (#2837).\n\n  - Active and queued Quick Mode tasks are now adopted if     the peer reauthenticates an IKEv1 SA while creating lots     of CHILD_SAs.\n\n  - Newer versions of the FreeBSD kernel add an     SADB_X_EXT_SA2 extension to SADB_ACQUIRE messages, which     allows the kernel-pfkey plugin to determine the reqid of     the policy even if it wasn't installed by the daemon     previously (e.g. when using FreeBSD's if_ipsec(4) VTIs,     which install policies themselves, 872b9b3e8d).\n\n  - Added support for RSA signatures with SHA-256 and     SHA-512 to the agent plugin. For older versions of     ssh\/gpg-agent that only support SHA-1, IKEv2 signature     authentication has to be disabled via     charon.signature_authentication.\n\n  - The sshkey and agent plugins support Ed25519\/Ed448 SSH     keys and signatures.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports X25519\/X448 Diffie-Hellman     and Ed25519\/Ed448 keys and signatures when built against     OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n\n  - Support for Ed25519, ChaCha20\/Poly1305, SHA-3 and     AES-CCM were added to the botan plugin.\n\n  - The mysql plugin now properly handles database     connections with transactions under heavy load (#2779).\n\n  - IP addresses in ha pools are now distributed evenly     among all segments (#2828).\n\n  - Private key implementations may optionally provide a     list of supported signature schemes, which, as described     above, is used by the tpm plugin because for each key on     a TPM 2.0 the hash algorithm and for RSA also the     padding scheme is predefined.\n\n  - The testing environment is now based on Debian 9     (stretch) by default. This required some changes, in     particular, updating to FreeRADIUS 3.x (which forced us     to abandon the TNC@FHH patches and scenarios,     2fbe44bef3) and removing FIPS-enabled versions of     OpenSSL (the FIPS module only supports OpenSSL 1.0.2).\n\n  - Most test scenarios were migrated to swanctl.\n\nVersion 5.7.1\n\n  - Fixes a vulnerability in the gmp plugin triggered by     crafted certificates with RSA keys with very small     moduli. When verifying signatures with such keys, the     code patched with the fix for CVE-2018-16151\/2 caused an     integer underflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow     that results in a crash of the daemon.\n\n  - The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-17540.\n\nVersion 5.7.0\n\n  - Fixes a potential authorization bypass vulnerability in     the gmp plugin that was caused by a too lenient     verification of PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures. Several flaws     could be exploited by a Bleichenbacher-style attack to     forge signatures for low-exponent keys (i.e. with e=3).\n\n  - CVE-2018-16151 has been assigned to the problem of     accepting random bytes after the OID of the hash     function in such signatures, and CVE-2018-16152 has been     assigned to the issue of not verifying that the     parameters in the ASN.1 algorithmIdentitifer structure     is empty. Other flaws that don't lead to a vulnerability     directly (e.g. not checking for at least 8 bytes of     padding) have no separate CVE assigned.\n\n  - Dots are not allowed anymore in section names in     swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf. This mainly affects     the configuration of file loggers. If the path for such     a log file contains dots it now has to be configured in     the new path setting within the arbitrarily renamed     subsection in the filelog section.\n\n  - Sections in swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf may now     reference other sections. All settings and subsections     from such a section are inherited. This allows to     simplify configs as redundant information has only to be     specified once and may then be included in other     sections (see strongswan.conf for an example).\n\n  - The originally selected IKE config (based on the IPs and     IKE version) can now change if no matching algorithm     proposal is found. This way the order of the configs     doesn't matter that much anymore and it's easily     possible to specify separate configs for clients that     require weaker algorithms (instead of having to also add     them in other configs that might be selected).\n\n  - Support for Postquantum Preshared Keys for IKEv2     (draft-ietf-ipsecme-qr-ikev2) has been added. For an     example refer to the swanctl\/rw-cert-ppk scenario (or     with EAP, or PSK authentication).\n\n  - The new botan plugin is a wrapper around the Botan C++     crypto library. It requires a fairly recent build from     Botan's master branch (or the upcoming 2.8.0 release).\n    Thanks to Ren&Atilde;&#131;&Acirc;&copy; Korthaus and     his team from Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecurity for the     initial patch and to Jack Lloyd for quickly adding     missing functions to Botan's FFI (C89) interface.\n\n  - Implementation of RFC 8412 'Software Inventory Message     and Attributes (SWIMA) for PA-TNC'.\n\n  - SWIMA subscription option sets CLOSE_WRITE trigger on     apt history.log file resulting in a ClientRetry PB-TNC     batch to initialize a new measurement cycle. The new     imv\/imc-swima plugins replace the previous imv\/imc-swid     plugins, which were removed.\n\n  - Added support for fuzzing the PA-TNC (RFC 5792) and     PB-TNC (RFC 5793) NEA protocols on Google's OSS-Fuzz     infrastructure.\n\n  - Support for version 2 of Intel's TPM2-TSS TGC Software     Stack. The presence of the in-kernel \/dev\/tpmrm0     resource manager is automatically detected.\n\n  - The pki tool accepts a xmppAddr otherName as a     subjectAlternativeName using the syntax --san     xmppaddr:<jid>.\n\n  - swanctl.conf supports the configuration of marks the in-     and\/or outbound SA should apply to packets after     processing on Linux. Configuring such a mark for     outbound SAs requires at least a 4.14 kernel. The     ability to set a mask and configuring a mark\/mask for     inbound SAs will be added with the upcoming 4.19 kernel.\n\n  - New options in swanctl.conf allow configuring     how\/whether DF, ECN and DS fields in the IP headers are     copied during IPsec processing. Controlling this is     currently only possible on Linux.\n\n  - The handling of sequence numbers in IKEv1 DPDs has been     improved (#2714).\n\n  - To avoid conflicts, the dhcp plugin now only uses the     DHCP server port if explicitly configured.\n\nVersion 5.6.3\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if     the openssl plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is     negotiated as PRF. This vulnerability has been     registered as CVE-2018-10811.\n\n  - Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did     not check the received length before reading a message     from the socket. Unless a group is configured, root     privileges are required to access that socket, so in the     default configuration this shouldn't be an issue. This     vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-5388.\n\n  - CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid     problems in scenarios where expired certificates are     removed from new CRLs and the clock on the host doing     the revocation check is trailing behind that of the host     issuing CRLs. Not doing this could result in accepting a     revoked and expired certificate, if it's still valid     according to the trailing clock but not contained     anymore in not yet valid CRLs.\n\n  - The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer     of the checked certificate (#2608).\n\n  - CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a     skipped check because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are     now stored also for intermediate CA certificates and not     only for end-entity certificates, so a strict CRL policy     can be enforced in such cases.\n\n  - In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2,     certificates used for IKE must now either not contain a     keyUsage extension (like the ones generated by pki), or     have at least one of the digitalSignature or     nonRepudiation bits set.\n\n  - New options for vici\/swanctl allow forcing the local     termination of an IKE_SA. This might be useful in     situations where it's known the other end is not     reachable anymore, or that it already removed the     IKE_SA, so retransmitting a DELETE and waiting for a     response would be pointless.\n\n  - Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response     (i.e. shorter than all retransmits would be) before     destroying the IKE_SA is also possible by additionally     specifying a timeout in the forced termination request.\n\n  - When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now     checks if it tracks other routes for the same     destination and replaces the installed route instead of     just removing it. Same during installation, where     existing routes previously weren't replaced. This should     allow using traps with virtual IPs on Linux (#2162).\n\n  - The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier     DHCP option if the identity_lease setting is enabled     (7b660944b6). It can also send identities of up to 255     bytes length, instead of the previous 64 bytes     (30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server address is     configured, DHCP requests are now sent from port 67     instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port unreachables     (becf027cd9).\n\n  - The handling of faulty INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g.\n    one containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during     CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges has been improved (#2536).\n\n  - Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs     (there is no MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).\n\n  - ChaCha20\/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key     length (#2614). For compatibility with older releases     the chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in     proposals to also propose the algorithm with a key     length (c58434aeff).\n\n  - Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now     more flexible and allows a new setting (auto), which     automatically uses it if the kernel and device both     support it. If hw offload is set to yes and offloading     is not supported, the CHILD_SA installation now fails.\n\n  - The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via     internal interface (one with an IP in the local traffic     selector). On FreeBSD, enabling this selects the correct     source IP when sending packets from the gateway itself     (e811659323).\n\n  - SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as     generated by OpenSSL 1.1 (#2574).\n\n  - The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs     from directories.\n\n  - The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the     remote port is not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the     response to a different port, as might happen on Azure),     as long as the local port is 500 (85bfab621d).\n\n  - Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager     in charon-nm (ee8c25516a).\n\n  - Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol     if either protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).\n\n  - Only the inbound SA\/policy will be updated as reaction     to IP address changes for rekeyed CHILD_SAs that are     kept around.\n\n  - The parser for strongswan.conf\/swanctl.conf now accepts     = characters in values without having to put the value     in quotes (e.g. for Base64 encoded shared secrets).\n\n    Notes for developers :\n\n  - trap_manager_t: Trap policies are now unistalled by     peer\/child name and not the reqid.\n\n  - No reqid is returned anymore when installing trap     policies.\n\n  - child_sa_t: A new state (CHILD_DELETED) is used for     CHILD_SAs that have been deleted but not yet destroyed     (after a rekeying CHILD_SAs are kept around for a while     to process delayed packets). This way child_updown     events are not triggered anymore for such SAs when an     IKE_SA that has such CHILD_SAs assigned is deleted.\n\nVersion 5.6.2\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1     RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient     input validation. One of the configurable parameters in     algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS     signatures is the mask generation function (MGF). Only     MGF1 is currently specified for this purpose. However,     this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the     underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not     correctly handle the case of this parameter being     absent, causing an undefined data read. This     vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.\n\n  - When rekeying IKEv2 IKE_SAs the previously negotiated DH     group will be reused, instead of using the first     configured group, which avoids an additional exchange if     the peer previously selected a different DH group via     INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify. The same is also done when     rekeying CHILD_SAs except for the first rekeying of the     CHILD_SA that was created with the IKE_SA, where no DH     group was negotiated yet. Also, the selected DH group is     moved to the front in all sent proposals that contain it     and all proposals that don't are moved to the back in     order to convey the preference for this group to the     peer.\n\n  - Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In     particular, the response to an address update (with     NAT-D payloads) is not ignored anymore if only an     address list update or DPD is queued as that could     prevent updating the UDP encapsulation in the kernel.\n\n  - On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by     changes to the routing rules, which can be useful if     routing rules (instead of e.g. route metrics) are used     to switch from one to another interface (i.e. from one     to another routing table). Since routing rules are     currently not evaluated when doing route lookups this is     only useful if the kernel-based route lookup is used     (4664992f7d).\n\n  - The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic     leaks when replacing addresses in installed policies are     now replaced by temporary drop policies, which also     prevent acquires because we currently delete and     reinstall IPsec SAs to update their addresses     (35ef1b032d).\n\n  - Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage     of a TPM 2.0 referenced via the NV index. Adding the\n    --keyid parameter to pki\n\n    --print allows to print private keys or certificates     stored in a smartcard or a TPM 2.0.\n\n  - Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH     groups in the ESP proposal during IKE_AUTH and also if a     DH group is configured in the local ESP proposal and     charon.prefer configured_proposals is disabled     (d058fd3c32).\n\n  - The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved     for certain scenarios (see #2497 for details).\n\n  - MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to     avoid compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs     that have a block size Version 5.6.1\n\n  - Several algorithms were removed from the default ESP\/AH     and IKE proposals in compliance with RFC 8221 and RFC     8247, respectively. Removed from the default ESP\/AH     proposal were the 3DES and Blowfish encryption     algorithms and the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm. From     the IKE default proposal the HMAC-MD5 integrity     algorithm and the MODP-1024 Diffie-Hellman group were     removed (the latter is significant for Windows clients     in their default configuration). These algorithms may     still be used in custom proposals.\n\n  - Support for RSASSA-PSS signatures has been added. For     compatibility with previous releases they are currently     not used automatically, by default, to change that     charon.rsa_pss may be enabled. To explicitly use or     require such signatures during IKEv2 signature     authentication (RFC 7427) ike:rsa\/pss... authentication     constraints may be used for specific connections     (regardless of whether the strongswan.conf option above     is enabled). Only the hash algorithm can be specified in     such constraints, the MGF1 will be based on that hash     and the salt length will equal the hash length (when     verifying the salt length is not enforced). To enforce     such signatures during PKI verification use rsa\/pss...\n    authentication constraints.\n\n  - All pki commands that create certificates\/CRLs can be     made to sign with RSASSA-PSS instead of the classing     PKCS#1 scheme with the --rsa-padding pss option. As with     signatures during authentication, only the hash     algorithm is configurable (via --digest option), the     MGF1 will be based on that and the salt length will     equal the hash length.\n\n  - These signatures are supported by all RSA backends     except pkcs11 (i.e. gmp, gcrypt, openssl). The gmp     plugin requires the mgf1 plugin. Note that RSASSA-PSS     algorithm identifiers and parameters in keys (public     keys in certificates or private keys in PKCS#8 files)     are currently not used as constraints.\n\n  - The sec-updater tool checks for security updates in     dpkg-based repositories (e.g. Debian\/Ubuntu) and sets     the security flags in the IMV policy database     accordingly. Additionally for each new package version a     SWID tag for the given OS and HW architecture is created     and stored in the database.\n\n  - Using the sec-updater.sh script template the lookup can     be automated (e.g. via an hourly cron job).\n\n  - When restarting an IKEv2 negotiation after receiving an     INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify (or due to other reasons like     too many retransmits) a new initiator SPI is allocated.\n    This prevents issues caused by retransmits for     IKE_SA_INIT messages.\n\n  - Because the initiator SPI was previously reused when     restarting the connection delayed responses for previous     connection attempts were processed and might have caused     fatal errors due to a failed DH negotiation or because     of the internal retry counter in the ike-init task. For     instance, if we proposed a DH group the responder     rejected we might have later received delayed responses     that either contained INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies with     the DH group we already switched to, or, if we     retransmitted an IKE_SA_INIT with the requested group     but then had to restart again, a KE payload with a group     different from the one we proposed.\n\n  - The introduction of file versions in the IMV database     scheme broke file reference hash measurements. This has     been fixed by creating generic product versions having     an empty package name.\n\n  - A new timeout option for the systime-fix plugin stops     periodic system time checks after a while and enforces a     certificate verification, closing or reauthenticating     all SAs with invalid certificates.\n\n  - The IKE event counters, previously only available via     ipsec listcounters command, may now also be queried and     reset via vici and the new swanctl --counters command.\n    They are collected and provided by the optional counters     plugin (enabled by default for backwards compatibility     if the stroke plugin is built).\n\n  - Class attributes received in RADIUS Access-Accept     messages may optionally be added to RADIUS accounting     messages (655924074b).\n\n  - Basic support for systemd sockets has been added, which     may be used for privilege separation (59db98fb94).\n\n  - Inbound marks may optionally be installed in the SA     again (was removed with 5.5.2) by enabling the     mark_in_sa option in swanctl.conf.\n\n  - The timeout of leases in pools configured via pool     utility may be configured in other units than hours.\n    INITIAL_CONTACT notifies are now only omitted if never     is configured as uniqueness policy.\n\n  - Outbound FWD policies for shunts are not installed     anymore, by default (as is the case for other policies     since 5.5.1).\n\n  - Don't consider a DH group mismatch during CHILD_SA     rekeying as failure as responder (e7276f78aa).\n\n  - Handling of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets in libipsec     has been improved (e138003de9).\n\n  - Trigger expire events for the correct IPsec SA in     libipsec (6e861947a0).\n\n  - A crash in CRL verification via openssl plugin using     OpenSSL 1.1 has been fixed (78acaba6a1).\n\n  - No hard-coded default proposals are passed from starter     to the stroke plugin anymore (the IKE proposal used     curve25519 since 5.5.2, which is an optional plugin).\n\n  - A workaround for an issue with virtual IPs on macOS     10.13 (High Sierra) has been added (039b85dd43).\n\n  - Handling of IKE_SA rekey collisions in charon-tkm has     been fixed.\n\n  - Instead of failing or just silently doing nothing unit     tests may now warn about certain conditions (e.g. if a     test was not executed due to external dependencies).\n\nNote that Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding description block directly from the SUSE security advisory. Tenable has attempted to automatically clean and format it as much as possible without introducing additional issues.","cvss3":[],"published":"2020-03-24T00:00:00","type":"nessus","title":"SUSE SLED15 \/ SLES15 Security Update : strongswan (SUSE-SU-2020:0743-1)","bulletinFamily":"scanner","cvss2":[],"cvelist":["CVE-2018-10811","CVE-2018-16151","CVE-2018-16152","CVE-2018-17540","CVE-2018-5388","CVE-2018-6459"],"modified":"2024-03-21T00:00:00","cpe":["p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-debugsource","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-hmac","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-ipsec","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-ipsec-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-libs0","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-libs0-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-mysql","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-mysql-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-nm","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-nm-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-sqlite","p-cpe:\/a:novell:suse_linux:strongswan-sqlite-debuginfo","cpe:\/o:novell:suse_linux:15"],"id":"SUSE_SU-2020-0743-1.NASL","href":"https:\/\/www.tenable.com\/plugins\/nessus\/134852","sourceData":"#\n# (C) Tenable Network Security, Inc.\n#\n# The descriptive text and package checks in this plugin were\n# extracted from SUSE update advisory SUSE-SU-2020:0743-1.\n# The text itself is copyright (C) SUSE.\n#\n\ninclude('compat.inc');\n\nif (description)\n{\n  script_id(134852);\n  script_version(\"1.4\");\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"plugin_modification_date\", value:\"2024\/03\/21\");\n\n  script_cve_id(\n    \"CVE-2018-10811\",\n    \"CVE-2018-16151\",\n    \"CVE-2018-16152\",\n    \"CVE-2018-17540\",\n    \"CVE-2018-5388\",\n    \"CVE-2018-6459\"\n  );\n\n  script_name(english:\"SUSE SLED15 \/ SLES15 Security Update : strongswan (SUSE-SU-2020:0743-1)\");\n\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"synopsis\", value:\n\"The remote SUSE host is missing one or more security updates.\");\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"description\", value:\n\"This update for strongswan fixes the following issues :\n\nStrongswan was updated to version 5.8.2 (jsc#SLE-11370).\n\nSecurity issue fixed :\n\nCVE-2018-6459: Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1\nRSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient input validation\n(bsc#1079548).\n\nFull changelogs :\n\nVersion 5.8.2\n\n  - Identity-based CA constraints, which enforce that the\n    certificate chain of the remote peer contains a CA\n    certificate with a specific identity, are supported via\n    vici\/swanctl.conf. This is similar to the existing CA\n    constraints but doesn't require that the CA certificate\n    is locally installed, for instance, intermediate CA\n    certificates received from the peers. Wildcard identity\n    matching (e.g. ..., OU=Research, CN=*) could also be\n    used for the latter but requires trust in the\n    intermediate CAs to only issue certificates with\n    legitimate subject DNs (e.g. the 'Sales' CA must not\n    issue certificates with OU=Research). With the new\n    constraint that's not necessary as long as a path length\n    basic constraint (--pathlen for pki --issue) prevents\n    intermediate CAs from issuing further intermediate CAs.\n\n  - Intermediate CA certificates may now be sent in\n    hash-and-URL encoding by configuring a base URL for the\n    parent CA (#3234, swanctl\/rw-hash-and-url-multi-level).\n\n  - Implemented NIST SP-800-90A Deterministic Random Bit\n    Generator (DRBG) based on AES-CTR and SHA2-HMAC modes.\n    Currently used by the gmp and ntru plugins.\n\n  - Random nonces sent in an OCSP requests are now expected\n    in the corresponding OCSP responses.\n\n  - The kernel-netlink plugin now ignores deprecated IPv6\n    addresses for MOBIKE. Whether temporary or permanent\n    IPv6 addresses are included now depends on the\n    charon.prefer_temporary_addrs setting (#3192).\n\n  - Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are configured via\n    PF_KEY if supported by the kernel.\n\n  - The PF_KEY socket's receive buffer in the kernel-pfkey\n    plugin is now cleared before sending requests, as many\n    of the messages sent by the kernel are sent as\n    broadcasts to all PF_KEY sockets. This is an issue if an\n    external tool is used to manage SAs\/policies unrelated\n    to IPsec (#3225).\n\n  - The vici plugin now uses unique section names for\n    CHILD_SAs in child-updown events (7c74ce9190).\n\n  - For individually deleted CHILD_SAs (in particular for\n    IKEv1) the vici child-updown event now includes more\n    information about the CHILD_SAs such as traffic\n    statistics (#3198).\n\n  - Custom loggers are correctly re-registered if log levels\n    are changed via stroke loglevel (#3182).\n\n  - Avoid lockups during startup on low entropy systems when\n    using OpenSSL 1.1.1 (095a2c2eac).\n\n  - Instead of failing later when setting a key, creating\n    HMACs via openssl plugin now fails instantly if the\n    underlying hash algorithm isn't supported (e.g. MD5 in\n    FIPS-mode) so fallbacks to other plugins work properly\n    (#3284).\n\n  - Exponents of RSA keys read from TPM 2.0 via SAPI are\n    correctly converted (8ee1242f1438).\n\n  - Routing table IDs > 255 are supported for custom routes\n    on Linux.\n\n  - To avoid races, the check for hardware offloading\n    support in the kernel-netlink plugin is performed during\n    initialization of the plugin (a605452c03).\n\n  - The D-Bus config file for charon-nm is now installed in\n    $(datadir)\/dbus-1\/system.d instead of\n    $(sysconfdir)\/dbus-1\/system.d, which is intended for\n    sysadmin overrides. INVALID_MAJOR_VERSION notifies are\n    now correctly sent in messages of the same exchange type\n    and with the same message ID as the request.\n\n  - IKEv2 SAs are now immediately destroyed when sending or\n    receiving INVALID_SYNTAX notifies in authenticated\n    messages.\n\n  - For developers working from the repository the configure\n    script now aborts if GNU gperf is not found.\n\nVersion 5.8.1\n\n  - RDNs in DNs of X.509 certificates can now optionally be\n    matched less strict. The global strongswan.conf option\n    charon.rdn_matching takes two alternative values that\n    cause the matching algorithm to either ignore the order\n    of matched RDNs (reordered) or additionally (relaxed)\n    accept DNs that contain more RDNs than configured\n    (unmatched RDNs are treated like wildcard matches).\n\n  - The updown plugin now passes the same interface to the\n    script that is also used for the automatically installed\n    routes, that is, the interface over which the peer is\n    reached instead of the interface on which the local\n    address is found (#3095).\n\n  - TPM 2.0 contexts are now protected by a mutex to prevent\n    issues if multiple IKE_SAs use the same private key\n    concurrently (4b25885025).\n\n  - Do a rekey check after the third QM message was received\n    (#3060).\n\n  - If available, explicit_bzero() is now used as memwipe()\n    instead of our own implementation.\n\n  - An .editorconfig file has been added, mainly so Github\n    shows files with proper indentation (68346b6962).\n\n  - The internal certificate of the load-tester plugin has\n    been modified so it can again be used as end-entity cert\n    with 5.6.3 and later (#3139).\n\n  - The maximum data length of received COOKIE notifies (64\n    bytes) is now enforced (#3160).\n\nVersion 5.8.0\n\n  - The systemd service units have been renamed. The modern\n    unit, which was called strongswan-swanctl, is now called\n    strongswan (the previous name is configured as alias in\n    the unit, for which a symlink is created when the unit\n    is enabled). The legacy unit is now called\n    strongswan-starter.\n\n  - Support for XFRM interfaces (available since Linux 4.19)\n    has been added, which are intended to replace VTI\n    devices (they are similar but offer several advantages,\n    for instance, they are not bound to an address or\n    address family).\n\n  - IPsec SAs and policies are associated with such\n    interfaces via interface IDs that can be configured in\n    swanctl.conf (dynamic IDs may optionally be allocated\n    for each SA and even direction). It's possible to use\n    separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic (or\n    only use an interface in one direction and regular\n    policies in the other).\n\n  - Interfaces may be created dynamically via updown\/vici\n    scripts, or statically before or after establishing the\n    SAs. Routes must be added manually as needed (the daemon\n    will not install any routes for outbound policies with\n    an interface ID).\n\n  - When moving XFRM interfaces to other network namespaces\n    they retain access to the SAs and policies installed in\n    the original namespace, which allows providing IPsec\n    tunnels for processes in other network namespaces\n    without giving them access to the IPsec keys or IKE\n    credentials. More information can be found on the page\n    about route-based VPNs.\n\n  - Initiation of childless IKE_SAs is supported (RFC 6023).\n    If enabled and supported by the responder, no CHILD_SA\n    is established during IKE_AUTH. Instead, all CHILD_SAs\n    are created with CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges. This allows\n    using a separate DH exchange even for the first\n    CHILD_SA, which is otherwise created during IKE_AUTH\n    with keys derived from the IKE_SA's key material.\n\n  - The swanctl --initiate command may be used to initiate\n    only the IKE_SA via --ike option if --child is omitted\n    and the peer supports this extension.\n\n  - The NetworkManager backend and plugin support IPv6.\n\n  - The new wolfssl plugin is a wrapper around the wolfSSL\n    crypto library. Thanks to Sean Parkinson of wolfSSL Inc.\n    for the initial patch.\n\n  - IKE SPIs may optionally be labeled via the\n    charon.spi_mask|label options in strongswan.conf. This\n    feature was extracted from charon-tkm, however, now\n    applies the mask\/label in network order.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 when built\n    with OpenSSL 1.1.0.\n\n  - The PB-TNC finite state machine according to section 3.2\n    of RFC 5793 was not correctly implemented when sending\n    either a CRETRY or SRETRY batch. These batches can only\n    be sent in the 'Decided' state and a CRETRY batch can\n    immediately carry all messages usually transported by a\n    CDATA batch. It is currently not possible to send a\n    SRETRY batch since full-duplex mode for PT-TLS transport\n    is not supported.\n\n  - Instead of marking IPv6 virtual IPs as deprecated, the\n    kernel-netlink plugin now uses address labels to avoid\n    that such addresses are used for non-VPN traffic\n    (00a953d090).\n\n  - The agent plugin now creates sockets to the\n    ssh\/gpg-agent dynamically and does not keep them open,\n    which otherwise might prevent the agent from getting\n    terminated.\n\n  - To avoid broadcast loops the forecast plugin now only\n    reinjects packets that are marked or received from the\n    configured interface.\n\n  - UTF-8 encoded passwords are supported via EAP-MSCHAPv2,\n    which internally uses an UTF-16LE encoding to calculate\n    the NT hash (#3014).\n\n  - Properly delete temporary drop policies (used when\n    updating IP addresses of SAs) if manual priorities are\n    used, which was broken since 5.6.2 (8e31d65730).\n\n  - Avoid overwriting start_action when parsing the\n    inactivity timeout in the vici plugin (#2954).\n\n  - Fixed the automatic termination of reloaded vici\n    connections with start_action=start, which was broken\n    since 5.6.3 (71b22c250f).\n\n  - The lookup for shared secrets for IKEv1 SAs via sql\n    plugin should now work better (6ec9f68f32).\n\n  - Fixed a race condition in the trap manager between\n    installation and removal of a policy (69cbe2ca3f).\n\n  - The IPsec stack detection and module loading in starter\n    has been removed (it wasn't enforced anyway and loading\n    modules doesn't seem necessary, also KLIPS hasn't been\n    supported for a long time and PF_KEY will eventually be\n    removed from the Linux kernel, ba817d2917).\n\n  - Several IKEv2 protocol details are now handled more\n    strictly: Unrequested virtual IPs are ignored, CFG_REPLY\n    payloads are ignored if no CFG_REQUEST payloads were\n    sent, a USE TRANSPORT_MODE notify received from the\n    responder is checked against the local configuration.\n\n  - The keys and certificates used by the scenarios in the\n    testing environment are now generated dynamically.\n    Running the testing\/scripts\/build-certs script after\n    creating the base and root images uses the pki utility\n    installed in the latter to create the keys and\n    certificates for all the CAs and in some cases for\n    individual scenarios. These credentials are stored in\n    the source tree, not the image, so this has to be called\n    only once even if the images are later rebuilt. The\n    script automatically (re-)rebuilds the guest images as\n    that generates fresh CRLs and signs the DNS zones. The\n    only keys\/certificates currently not generated are the\n    very large ones used by the ikev2\/rw-eap-tls-fragments\n    scenario.\n\nVersion 5.7.2\n\n  - For RSA with PSS padding, the TPM 2.0 specification\n    mandates the maximum salt length (as defined by the\n    length of the key and hash). However, if the TPM is\n    FIPS-168-4 compliant, the salt length equals the hash\n    length. This is assumed for FIPS-140-2 compliant TPMs,\n    but if that's not the case, it might be necessary to\n    manually enable charon.plugins.tpm.fips_186_4 if the TPM\n    doesn't use the maximum salt length.\n\n  - Directories for credentials loaded by swanctl are now\n    accessed relative to the loaded swanctl.conf file, in\n    particular, when loading it from a custom location via\n    --file argument.\n\n  - The base directory, which is used if no custom location\n    for swanctl.conf is specified, is now also configurable\n    at runtime via SWANCTL_DIR environment variable.\n\n  - If RADIUS Accounting is enabled, the eap-radius plugin\n    will add the session ID (Acct-Session-Id) to\n    Access-Request messages, which e.g. simplifies\n    associating database entries for IP leases and\n    accounting with sessions (the session ID does not change\n    when IKE_SAs are rekeyed, #2853).\n\n  - All IP addresses assigned by a RADIUS server are\n    included in Accounting-Stop messages even if the client\n    did not claim them, allowing to release them early in\n    case of connection errors (#2856).\n\n  - Selectors installed on transport mode SAs by the\n    kernel-netlink plugin are now updated if an IP address\n    changes (e.g. via MOBIKE) and it was part of the\n    selectors.\n\n  - No deletes are sent anymore when a rekeyed CHILD_SA\n    expires (#2815).\n\n  - The bypass-lan plugin now tracks interfaces to handle\n    subnets that move from one interface to another and\n    properly update associated routes (#2820).\n\n  - Only valid and expected inbound IKEv2 messages are used\n    to update the timestamp of the last received message\n    (previously, retransmits also triggered an update).\n\n  - IKEv2 requests from responders are now ignored until the\n    IKE_SA is fully established (e.g. if a DPD request from\n    the peer arrives before the IKE_AUTH response does,\n    46bea1add9). Delayed IKE_SA_INIT responses with COOKIE\n    notifies we already recevied are ignored, they caused\n    another reset of the IKE_SA previously (#2837).\n\n  - Active and queued Quick Mode tasks are now adopted if\n    the peer reauthenticates an IKEv1 SA while creating lots\n    of CHILD_SAs.\n\n  - Newer versions of the FreeBSD kernel add an\n    SADB_X_EXT_SA2 extension to SADB_ACQUIRE messages, which\n    allows the kernel-pfkey plugin to determine the reqid of\n    the policy even if it wasn't installed by the daemon\n    previously (e.g. when using FreeBSD's if_ipsec(4) VTIs,\n    which install policies themselves, 872b9b3e8d).\n\n  - Added support for RSA signatures with SHA-256 and\n    SHA-512 to the agent plugin. For older versions of\n    ssh\/gpg-agent that only support SHA-1, IKEv2 signature\n    authentication has to be disabled via\n    charon.signature_authentication.\n\n  - The sshkey and agent plugins support Ed25519\/Ed448 SSH\n    keys and signatures.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports X25519\/X448 Diffie-Hellman\n    and Ed25519\/Ed448 keys and signatures when built against\n    OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n\n  - Support for Ed25519, ChaCha20\/Poly1305, SHA-3 and\n    AES-CCM were added to the botan plugin.\n\n  - The mysql plugin now properly handles database\n    connections with transactions under heavy load (#2779).\n\n  - IP addresses in ha pools are now distributed evenly\n    among all segments (#2828).\n\n  - Private key implementations may optionally provide a\n    list of supported signature schemes, which, as described\n    above, is used by the tpm plugin because for each key on\n    a TPM 2.0 the hash algorithm and for RSA also the\n    padding scheme is predefined.\n\n  - The testing environment is now based on Debian 9\n    (stretch) by default. This required some changes, in\n    particular, updating to FreeRADIUS 3.x (which forced us\n    to abandon the TNC@FHH patches and scenarios,\n    2fbe44bef3) and removing FIPS-enabled versions of\n    OpenSSL (the FIPS module only supports OpenSSL 1.0.2).\n\n  - Most test scenarios were migrated to swanctl.\n\nVersion 5.7.1\n\n  - Fixes a vulnerability in the gmp plugin triggered by\n    crafted certificates with RSA keys with very small\n    moduli. When verifying signatures with such keys, the\n    code patched with the fix for CVE-2018-16151\/2 caused an\n    integer underflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow\n    that results in a crash of the daemon.\n\n  - The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-17540.\n\nVersion 5.7.0\n\n  - Fixes a potential authorization bypass vulnerability in\n    the gmp plugin that was caused by a too lenient\n    verification of PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures. Several flaws\n    could be exploited by a Bleichenbacher-style attack to\n    forge signatures for low-exponent keys (i.e. with e=3).\n\n  - CVE-2018-16151 has been assigned to the problem of\n    accepting random bytes after the OID of the hash\n    function in such signatures, and CVE-2018-16152 has been\n    assigned to the issue of not verifying that the\n    parameters in the ASN.1 algorithmIdentitifer structure\n    is empty. Other flaws that don't lead to a vulnerability\n    directly (e.g. not checking for at least 8 bytes of\n    padding) have no separate CVE assigned.\n\n  - Dots are not allowed anymore in section names in\n    swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf. This mainly affects\n    the configuration of file loggers. If the path for such\n    a log file contains dots it now has to be configured in\n    the new path setting within the arbitrarily renamed\n    subsection in the filelog section.\n\n  - Sections in swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf may now\n    reference other sections. All settings and subsections\n    from such a section are inherited. This allows to\n    simplify configs as redundant information has only to be\n    specified once and may then be included in other\n    sections (see strongswan.conf for an example).\n\n  - The originally selected IKE config (based on the IPs and\n    IKE version) can now change if no matching algorithm\n    proposal is found. This way the order of the configs\n    doesn't matter that much anymore and it's easily\n    possible to specify separate configs for clients that\n    require weaker algorithms (instead of having to also add\n    them in other configs that might be selected).\n\n  - Support for Postquantum Preshared Keys for IKEv2\n    (draft-ietf-ipsecme-qr-ikev2) has been added. For an\n    example refer to the swanctl\/rw-cert-ppk scenario (or\n    with EAP, or PSK authentication).\n\n  - The new botan plugin is a wrapper around the Botan C++\n    crypto library. It requires a fairly recent build from\n    Botan's master branch (or the upcoming 2.8.0 release).\n    Thanks to Ren&Atilde;&#131;&Acirc;&copy; Korthaus and\n    his team from Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecurity for the\n    initial patch and to Jack Lloyd for quickly adding\n    missing functions to Botan's FFI (C89) interface.\n\n  - Implementation of RFC 8412 'Software Inventory Message\n    and Attributes (SWIMA) for PA-TNC'.\n\n  - SWIMA subscription option sets CLOSE_WRITE trigger on\n    apt history.log file resulting in a ClientRetry PB-TNC\n    batch to initialize a new measurement cycle. The new\n    imv\/imc-swima plugins replace the previous imv\/imc-swid\n    plugins, which were removed.\n\n  - Added support for fuzzing the PA-TNC (RFC 5792) and\n    PB-TNC (RFC 5793) NEA protocols on Google's OSS-Fuzz\n    infrastructure.\n\n  - Support for version 2 of Intel's TPM2-TSS TGC Software\n    Stack. The presence of the in-kernel \/dev\/tpmrm0\n    resource manager is automatically detected.\n\n  - The pki tool accepts a xmppAddr otherName as a\n    subjectAlternativeName using the syntax --san\n    xmppaddr:<jid>.\n\n  - swanctl.conf supports the configuration of marks the in-\n    and\/or outbound SA should apply to packets after\n    processing on Linux. Configuring such a mark for\n    outbound SAs requires at least a 4.14 kernel. The\n    ability to set a mask and configuring a mark\/mask for\n    inbound SAs will be added with the upcoming 4.19 kernel.\n\n  - New options in swanctl.conf allow configuring\n    how\/whether DF, ECN and DS fields in the IP headers are\n    copied during IPsec processing. Controlling this is\n    currently only possible on Linux.\n\n  - The handling of sequence numbers in IKEv1 DPDs has been\n    improved (#2714).\n\n  - To avoid conflicts, the dhcp plugin now only uses the\n    DHCP server port if explicitly configured.\n\nVersion 5.6.3\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if\n    the openssl plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is\n    negotiated as PRF. This vulnerability has been\n    registered as CVE-2018-10811.\n\n  - Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did\n    not check the received length before reading a message\n    from the socket. Unless a group is configured, root\n    privileges are required to access that socket, so in the\n    default configuration this shouldn't be an issue. This\n    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-5388.\n\n  - CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid\n    problems in scenarios where expired certificates are\n    removed from new CRLs and the clock on the host doing\n    the revocation check is trailing behind that of the host\n    issuing CRLs. Not doing this could result in accepting a\n    revoked and expired certificate, if it's still valid\n    according to the trailing clock but not contained\n    anymore in not yet valid CRLs.\n\n  - The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer\n    of the checked certificate (#2608).\n\n  - CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a\n    skipped check because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are\n    now stored also for intermediate CA certificates and not\n    only for end-entity certificates, so a strict CRL policy\n    can be enforced in such cases.\n\n  - In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2,\n    certificates used for IKE must now either not contain a\n    keyUsage extension (like the ones generated by pki), or\n    have at least one of the digitalSignature or\n    nonRepudiation bits set.\n\n  - New options for vici\/swanctl allow forcing the local\n    termination of an IKE_SA. This might be useful in\n    situations where it's known the other end is not\n    reachable anymore, or that it already removed the\n    IKE_SA, so retransmitting a DELETE and waiting for a\n    response would be pointless.\n\n  - Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response\n    (i.e. shorter than all retransmits would be) before\n    destroying the IKE_SA is also possible by additionally\n    specifying a timeout in the forced termination request.\n\n  - When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now\n    checks if it tracks other routes for the same\n    destination and replaces the installed route instead of\n    just removing it. Same during installation, where\n    existing routes previously weren't replaced. This should\n    allow using traps with virtual IPs on Linux (#2162).\n\n  - The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier\n    DHCP option if the identity_lease setting is enabled\n    (7b660944b6). It can also send identities of up to 255\n    bytes length, instead of the previous 64 bytes\n    (30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server address is\n    configured, DHCP requests are now sent from port 67\n    instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port unreachables\n    (becf027cd9).\n\n  - The handling of faulty INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g.\n    one containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during\n    CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges has been improved (#2536).\n\n  - Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs\n    (there is no MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).\n\n  - ChaCha20\/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key\n    length (#2614). For compatibility with older releases\n    the chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in\n    proposals to also propose the algorithm with a key\n    length (c58434aeff).\n\n  - Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now\n    more flexible and allows a new setting (auto), which\n    automatically uses it if the kernel and device both\n    support it. If hw offload is set to yes and offloading\n    is not supported, the CHILD_SA installation now fails.\n\n  - The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via\n    internal interface (one with an IP in the local traffic\n    selector). On FreeBSD, enabling this selects the correct\n    source IP when sending packets from the gateway itself\n    (e811659323).\n\n  - SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as\n    generated by OpenSSL 1.1 (#2574).\n\n  - The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs\n    from directories.\n\n  - The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the\n    remote port is not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the\n    response to a different port, as might happen on Azure),\n    as long as the local port is 500 (85bfab621d).\n\n  - Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager\n    in charon-nm (ee8c25516a).\n\n  - Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol\n    if either protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).\n\n  - Only the inbound SA\/policy will be updated as reaction\n    to IP address changes for rekeyed CHILD_SAs that are\n    kept around.\n\n  - The parser for strongswan.conf\/swanctl.conf now accepts\n    = characters in values without having to put the value\n    in quotes (e.g. for Base64 encoded shared secrets).\n\n    Notes for developers :\n\n  - trap_manager_t: Trap policies are now unistalled by\n    peer\/child name and not the reqid.\n\n  - No reqid is returned anymore when installing trap\n    policies.\n\n  - child_sa_t: A new state (CHILD_DELETED) is used for\n    CHILD_SAs that have been deleted but not yet destroyed\n    (after a rekeying CHILD_SAs are kept around for a while\n    to process delayed packets). This way child_updown\n    events are not triggered anymore for such SAs when an\n    IKE_SA that has such CHILD_SAs assigned is deleted.\n\nVersion 5.6.2\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1\n    RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient\n    input validation. One of the configurable parameters in\n    algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS\n    signatures is the mask generation function (MGF). Only\n    MGF1 is currently specified for this purpose. However,\n    this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the\n    underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not\n    correctly handle the case of this parameter being\n    absent, causing an undefined data read. This\n    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.\n\n  - When rekeying IKEv2 IKE_SAs the previously negotiated DH\n    group will be reused, instead of using the first\n    configured group, which avoids an additional exchange if\n    the peer previously selected a different DH group via\n    INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify. The same is also done when\n    rekeying CHILD_SAs except for the first rekeying of the\n    CHILD_SA that was created with the IKE_SA, where no DH\n    group was negotiated yet. Also, the selected DH group is\n    moved to the front in all sent proposals that contain it\n    and all proposals that don't are moved to the back in\n    order to convey the preference for this group to the\n    peer.\n\n  - Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In\n    particular, the response to an address update (with\n    NAT-D payloads) is not ignored anymore if only an\n    address list update or DPD is queued as that could\n    prevent updating the UDP encapsulation in the kernel.\n\n  - On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by\n    changes to the routing rules, which can be useful if\n    routing rules (instead of e.g. route metrics) are used\n    to switch from one to another interface (i.e. from one\n    to another routing table). Since routing rules are\n    currently not evaluated when doing route lookups this is\n    only useful if the kernel-based route lookup is used\n    (4664992f7d).\n\n  - The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic\n    leaks when replacing addresses in installed policies are\n    now replaced by temporary drop policies, which also\n    prevent acquires because we currently delete and\n    reinstall IPsec SAs to update their addresses\n    (35ef1b032d).\n\n  - Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage\n    of a TPM 2.0 referenced via the NV index. Adding the\n    --keyid parameter to pki\n\n    --print allows to print private keys or certificates\n    stored in a smartcard or a TPM 2.0.\n\n  - Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH\n    groups in the ESP proposal during IKE_AUTH and also if a\n    DH group is configured in the local ESP proposal and\n    charon.prefer configured_proposals is disabled\n    (d058fd3c32).\n\n  - The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved\n    for certain scenarios (see #2497 for details).\n\n  - MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to\n    avoid compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs\n    that have a block size Version 5.6.1\n\n  - Several algorithms were removed from the default ESP\/AH\n    and IKE proposals in compliance with RFC 8221 and RFC\n    8247, respectively. Removed from the default ESP\/AH\n    proposal were the 3DES and Blowfish encryption\n    algorithms and the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm. From\n    the IKE default proposal the HMAC-MD5 integrity\n    algorithm and the MODP-1024 Diffie-Hellman group were\n    removed (the latter is significant for Windows clients\n    in their default configuration). These algorithms may\n    still be used in custom proposals.\n\n  - Support for RSASSA-PSS signatures has been added. For\n    compatibility with previous releases they are currently\n    not used automatically, by default, to change that\n    charon.rsa_pss may be enabled. To explicitly use or\n    require such signatures during IKEv2 signature\n    authentication (RFC 7427) ike:rsa\/pss... authentication\n    constraints may be used for specific connections\n    (regardless of whether the strongswan.conf option above\n    is enabled). Only the hash algorithm can be specified in\n    such constraints, the MGF1 will be based on that hash\n    and the salt length will equal the hash length (when\n    verifying the salt length is not enforced). To enforce\n    such signatures during PKI verification use rsa\/pss...\n    authentication constraints.\n\n  - All pki commands that create certificates\/CRLs can be\n    made to sign with RSASSA-PSS instead of the classing\n    PKCS#1 scheme with the --rsa-padding pss option. As with\n    signatures during authentication, only the hash\n    algorithm is configurable (via --digest option), the\n    MGF1 will be based on that and the salt length will\n    equal the hash length.\n\n  - These signatures are supported by all RSA backends\n    except pkcs11 (i.e. gmp, gcrypt, openssl). The gmp\n    plugin requires the mgf1 plugin. Note that RSASSA-PSS\n    algorithm identifiers and parameters in keys (public\n    keys in certificates or private keys in PKCS#8 files)\n    are currently not used as constraints.\n\n  - The sec-updater tool checks for security updates in\n    dpkg-based repositories (e.g. Debian\/Ubuntu) and sets\n    the security flags in the IMV policy database\n    accordingly. Additionally for each new package version a\n    SWID tag for the given OS and HW architecture is created\n    and stored in the database.\n\n  - Using the sec-updater.sh script template the lookup can\n    be automated (e.g. via an hourly cron job).\n\n  - When restarting an IKEv2 negotiation after receiving an\n    INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify (or due to other reasons like\n    too many retransmits) a new initiator SPI is allocated.\n    This prevents issues caused by retransmits for\n    IKE_SA_INIT messages.\n\n  - Because the initiator SPI was previously reused when\n    restarting the connection delayed responses for previous\n    connection attempts were processed and might have caused\n    fatal errors due to a failed DH negotiation or because\n    of the internal retry counter in the ike-init task. For\n    instance, if we proposed a DH group the responder\n    rejected we might have later received delayed responses\n    that either contained INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies with\n    the DH group we already switched to, or, if we\n    retransmitted an IKE_SA_INIT with the requested group\n    but then had to restart again, a KE payload with a group\n    different from the one we proposed.\n\n  - The introduction of file versions in the IMV database\n    scheme broke file reference hash measurements. This has\n    been fixed by creating generic product versions having\n    an empty package name.\n\n  - A new timeout option for the systime-fix plugin stops\n    periodic system time checks after a while and enforces a\n    certificate verification, closing or reauthenticating\n    all SAs with invalid certificates.\n\n  - The IKE event counters, previously only available via\n    ipsec listcounters command, may now also be queried and\n    reset via vici and the new swanctl --counters command.\n    They are collected and provided by the optional counters\n    plugin (enabled by default for backwards compatibility\n    if the stroke plugin is built).\n\n  - Class attributes received in RADIUS Access-Accept\n    messages may optionally be added to RADIUS accounting\n    messages (655924074b).\n\n  - Basic support for systemd sockets has been added, which\n    may be used for privilege separation (59db98fb94).\n\n  - Inbound marks may optionally be installed in the SA\n    again (was removed with 5.5.2) by enabling the\n    mark_in_sa option in swanctl.conf.\n\n  - The timeout of leases in pools configured via pool\n    utility may be configured in other units than hours.\n    INITIAL_CONTACT notifies are now only omitted if never\n    is configured as uniqueness policy.\n\n  - Outbound FWD policies for shunts are not installed\n    anymore, by default (as is the case for other policies\n    since 5.5.1).\n\n  - Don't consider a DH group mismatch during CHILD_SA\n    rekeying as failure as responder (e7276f78aa).\n\n  - Handling of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets in libipsec\n    has been improved (e138003de9).\n\n  - Trigger expire events for the correct IPsec SA in\n    libipsec (6e861947a0).\n\n  - A crash in CRL verification via openssl plugin using\n    OpenSSL 1.1 has been fixed (78acaba6a1).\n\n  - No hard-coded default proposals are passed from starter\n    to the stroke plugin anymore (the IKE proposal used\n    curve25519 since 5.5.2, which is an optional plugin).\n\n  - A workaround for an issue with virtual IPs on macOS\n    10.13 (High Sierra) has been added (039b85dd43).\n\n  - Handling of IKE_SA rekey collisions in charon-tkm has\n    been fixed.\n\n  - Instead of failing or just silently doing nothing unit\n    tests may now warn about certain conditions (e.g. if a\n    test was not executed due to external dependencies).\n\nNote that Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding\ndescription block directly from the SUSE security advisory. Tenable\nhas attempted to automatically clean and format it as much as possible\nwithout introducing additional issues.\");\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"see_also\",

This is similar to the existing CA     constraints but doesn't require that the CA certificate     is locally installed, for instance, intermediate CA     certificates received from the peers. Wildcard identity     matching (e.g. ..., OU=Research, CN=*) could also be     used for the latter but requires trust in the     intermediate CAs to only issue certificates with     legitimate subject DNs (e.g. the 'Sales' CA must not     issue certificates with OU=Research). With the new     constraint that's not necessary as long as a path length     basic constraint (--pathlen for pki --issue) prevents     intermediate CAs from issuing further intermediate CAs.\n\n  - Intermediate CA certificates may now be sent in     hash-and-URL encoding by configuring a base URL for the     parent CA (#3234, swanctl\/rw-hash-and-url-multi-level).\n\n  - Implemented NIST SP-800-90A Deterministic Random Bit     Generator (DRBG) based on AES-CTR and SHA2-HMAC modes.\n    Currently used by the gmp and ntru plugins.\n\n  - Random nonces sent in an OCSP requests are now expected     in the corresponding OCSP responses.\n\n  - The kernel-netlink plugin now ignores deprecated IPv6     addresses for MOBIKE. Whether temporary or permanent     IPv6 addresses are included now depends on the     charon.prefer_temporary_addrs setting (#3192).\n\n  - Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are configured via     PF_KEY if supported by the kernel.\n\n  - The PF_KEY socket's receive buffer in the kernel-pfkey     plugin is now cleared before sending requests, as many     of the messages sent by the kernel are sent as     broadcasts to all PF_KEY sockets. This is an issue if an     external tool is used to manage SAs\/policies unrelated     to IPsec (#3225).\n\n  - The vici plugin now uses unique section names for     CHILD_SAs in child-updown events (7c74ce9190).\n\n  - For individually deleted CHILD_SAs (in particular for     IKEv1) the vici child-updown event now includes more     information about the CHILD_SAs such as traffic     statistics (#3198).\n\n  - Custom loggers are correctly re-registered if log levels     are changed via stroke loglevel (#3182).\n\n  - Avoid lockups during startup on low entropy systems when     using OpenSSL 1.1.1 (095a2c2eac).\n\n  - Instead of failing later when setting a key, creating     HMACs via openssl plugin now fails instantly if the     underlying hash algorithm isn't supported (e.g. MD5 in     FIPS-mode) so fallbacks to other plugins work properly     (#3284).\n\n  - Exponents of RSA keys read from TPM 2.0 via SAPI are     correctly converted (8ee1242f1438).\n\n  - Routing table IDs > 255 are supported for custom routes     on Linux.\n\n  - To avoid races, the check for hardware offloading     support in the kernel-netlink plugin is performed during     initialization of the plugin (a605452c03).\n\n  - The D-Bus config file for charon-nm is now installed in     $(datadir)\/dbus-1\/system.d instead of     $(sysconfdir)\/dbus-1\/system.d, which is intended for     sysadmin overrides. INVALID_MAJOR_VERSION notifies are     now correctly sent in messages of the same exchange type     and with the same message ID as the request.\n\n  - IKEv2 SAs are now immediately destroyed when sending or     receiving INVALID_SYNTAX notifies in authenticated     messages.\n\n  - For developers working from the repository the configure     script now aborts if GNU gperf is not found.\n\nVersion 5.8.1\n\n  - RDNs in DNs of X.509 certificates can now optionally be     matched less strict. The global strongswan.conf option     charon.rdn_matching takes two alternative values that     cause the matching algorithm to either ignore the order     of matched RDNs (reordered) or additionally (relaxed)     accept DNs that contain more RDNs than configured     (unmatched RDNs are treated like wildcard matches).\n\n  - The updown plugin now passes the same interface to the     script that is also used for the automatically installed     routes, that is, the interface over which the peer is     reached instead of the interface on which the local     address is found (#3095).\n\n  - TPM 2.0 contexts are now protected by a mutex to prevent     issues if multiple IKE_SAs use the same private key     concurrently (4b25885025).\n\n  - Do a rekey check after the third QM message was received     (#3060).\n\n  - If available, explicit_bzero() is now used as memwipe()     instead of our own implementation.\n\n  - An .editorconfig file has been added, mainly so Github     shows files with proper indentation (68346b6962).\n\n  - The internal certificate of the load-tester plugin has     been modified so it can again be used as end-entity cert     with 5.6.3 and later (#3139).\n\n  - The maximum data length of received COOKIE notifies (64     bytes) is now enforced (#3160).\n\nVersion 5.8.0\n\n  - The systemd service units have been renamed. The modern     unit, which was called strongswan-swanctl, is now called     strongswan (the previous name is configured as alias in     the unit, for which a symlink is created when the unit     is enabled). The legacy unit is now called     strongswan-starter.\n\n  - Support for XFRM interfaces (available since Linux 4.19)     has been added, which are intended to replace VTI     devices (they are similar but offer several advantages,     for instance, they are not bound to an address or     address family).\n\n  - IPsec SAs and policies are associated with such     interfaces via interface IDs that can be configured in     swanctl.conf (dynamic IDs may optionally be allocated     for each SA and even direction). It's possible to use     separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic (or     only use an interface in one direction and regular     policies in the other).\n\n  - Interfaces may be created dynamically via updown\/vici     scripts, or statically before or after establishing the     SAs. Routes must be added manually as needed (the daemon     will not install any routes for outbound policies with     an interface ID). \n\n  - When moving XFRM interfaces to other network namespaces     they retain access to the SAs and policies installed in     the original namespace, which allows providing IPsec     tunnels for processes in other network namespaces     without giving them access to the IPsec keys or IKE     credentials. More information can be found on the page     about route-based VPNs.\n\n  - Initiation of childless IKE_SAs is supported (RFC 6023).\n    If enabled and supported by the responder, no CHILD_SA     is established during IKE_AUTH. Instead, all CHILD_SAs     are created with CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges. This allows     using a separate DH exchange even for the first     CHILD_SA, which is otherwise created during IKE_AUTH     with keys derived from the IKE_SA's key material.\n\n  - The swanctl --initiate command may be used to initiate     only the IKE_SA via --ike option if --child is omitted     and the peer supports this extension.\n\n  - The NetworkManager backend and plugin support IPv6.\n\n  - The new wolfssl plugin is a wrapper around the wolfSSL     crypto library. Thanks to Sean Parkinson of wolfSSL Inc.\n    for the initial patch.\n\n  - IKE SPIs may optionally be labeled via the     charon.spi_mask|label options in strongswan.conf. This     feature was extracted from charon-tkm, however, now     applies the mask\/label in network order.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 when built     with OpenSSL 1.1.0.\n\n  - The PB-TNC finite state machine according to section 3.2     of RFC 5793 was not correctly implemented when sending     either a CRETRY or SRETRY batch. These batches can only     be sent in the 'Decided' state and a CRETRY batch can     immediately carry all messages usually transported by a     CDATA batch. It is currently not possible to send a     SRETRY batch since full-duplex mode for PT-TLS transport     is not supported.\n\n  - Instead of marking IPv6 virtual IPs as deprecated, the     kernel-netlink plugin now uses address labels to avoid     that such addresses are used for non-VPN traffic     (00a953d090).\n\n  - The agent plugin now creates sockets to the     ssh\/gpg-agent dynamically and does not keep them open,     which otherwise might prevent the agent from getting     terminated.\n\n  - To avoid broadcast loops the forecast plugin now only     reinjects packets that are marked or received from the     configured interface.\n\n  - UTF-8 encoded passwords are supported via EAP-MSCHAPv2,     which internally uses an UTF-16LE encoding to calculate     the NT hash (#3014).\n\n  - Properly delete temporary drop policies (used when     updating IP addresses of SAs) if manual priorities are     used, which was broken since 5.6.2 (8e31d65730).\n\n  - Avoid overwriting start_action when parsing the     inactivity timeout in the vici plugin (#2954).\n\n  - Fixed the automatic termination of reloaded vici     connections with start_action=start, which was broken     since 5.6.3 (71b22c250f).\n\n  - The lookup for shared secrets for IKEv1 SAs via sql     plugin should now work better (6ec9f68f32).\n\n  - Fixed a race condition in the trap manager between     installation and removal of a policy (69cbe2ca3f).\n\n  - The IPsec stack detection and module loading in starter     has been removed (it wasn't enforced anyway and loading     modules doesn't seem necessary, also KLIPS hasn't been     supported for a long time and PF_KEY will eventually be     removed from the Linux kernel, ba817d2917).\n\n  - Several IKEv2 protocol details are now handled more     strictly: Unrequested virtual IPs are ignored, CFG_REPLY     payloads are ignored if no CFG_REQUEST payloads were     sent, a USE TRANSPORT_MODE notify received from the     responder is checked against the local configuration.\n\n  - The keys and certificates used by the scenarios in the     testing environment are now generated dynamically.\n    Running the testing\/scripts\/build-certs script after     creating the base and root images uses the pki utility     installed in the latter to create the keys and     certificates for all the CAs and in some cases for     individual scenarios. These credentials are stored in     the source tree, not the image, so this has to be called     only once even if the images are later rebuilt. The     script automatically (re-)rebuilds the guest images as     that generates fresh CRLs and signs the DNS zones. The     only keys\/certificates currently not generated are the     very large ones used by the ikev2\/rw-eap-tls-fragments     scenario. \n\nVersion 5.7.2\n\n  - For RSA with PSS padding, the TPM 2.0 specification     mandates the maximum salt length (as defined by the     length of the key and hash). However, if the TPM is     FIPS-168-4 compliant, the salt length equals the hash     length. This is assumed for FIPS-140-2 compliant TPMs,     but if that's not the case, it might be necessary to     manually enable charon.plugins.tpm.fips_186_4 if the TPM     doesn't use the maximum salt length.\n\n  - Directories for credentials loaded by swanctl are now     accessed relative to the loaded swanctl.conf file, in     particular, when loading it from a custom location via\n    --file argument.\n\n  - The base directory, which is used if no custom location     for swanctl.conf is specified, is now also configurable     at runtime via SWANCTL_DIR environment variable.\n\n  - If RADIUS Accounting is enabled, the eap-radius plugin     will add the session ID (Acct-Session-Id) to     Access-Request messages, which e.g. simplifies     associating database entries for IP leases and     accounting with sessions (the session ID does not change     when IKE_SAs are rekeyed, #2853).\n\n  - All IP addresses assigned by a RADIUS server are     included in Accounting-Stop messages even if the client     did not claim them, allowing to release them early in     case of connection errors (#2856).\n\n  - Selectors installed on transport mode SAs by the     kernel-netlink plugin are now updated if an IP address     changes (e.g. via MOBIKE) and it was part of the     selectors.\n\n  - No deletes are sent anymore when a rekeyed CHILD_SA     expires (#2815).\n\n  - The bypass-lan plugin now tracks interfaces to handle     subnets that move from one interface to another and     properly update associated routes (#2820).\n\n  - Only valid and expected inbound IKEv2 messages are used     to update the timestamp of the last received message     (previously, retransmits also triggered an update).\n\n  - IKEv2 requests from responders are now ignored until the     IKE_SA is fully established (e.g. if a DPD request from     the peer arrives before the IKE_AUTH response does,     46bea1add9). Delayed IKE_SA_INIT responses with COOKIE     notifies we already recevied are ignored, they caused     another reset of the IKE_SA previously (#2837).\n\n  - Active and queued Quick Mode tasks are now adopted if     the peer reauthenticates an IKEv1 SA while creating lots     of CHILD_SAs.\n\n  - Newer versions of the FreeBSD kernel add an     SADB_X_EXT_SA2 extension to SADB_ACQUIRE messages, which     allows the kernel-pfkey plugin to determine the reqid of     the policy even if it wasn't installed by the daemon     previously (e.g. when using FreeBSD's if_ipsec(4) VTIs,     which install policies themselves, 872b9b3e8d).\n\n  - Added support for RSA signatures with SHA-256 and     SHA-512 to the agent plugin. For older versions of     ssh\/gpg-agent that only support SHA-1, IKEv2 signature     authentication has to be disabled via     charon.signature_authentication.\n\n  - The sshkey and agent plugins support Ed25519\/Ed448 SSH     keys and signatures.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports X25519\/X448 Diffie-Hellman     and Ed25519\/Ed448 keys and signatures when built against     OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n\n  - Support for Ed25519, ChaCha20\/Poly1305, SHA-3 and     AES-CCM were added to the botan plugin.\n\n  - The mysql plugin now properly handles database     connections with transactions under heavy load (#2779).\n\n  - IP addresses in ha pools are now distributed evenly     among all segments (#2828).\n\n  - Private key implementations may optionally provide a     list of supported signature schemes, which, as described     above, is used by the tpm plugin because for each key on     a TPM 2.0 the hash algorithm and for RSA also the     padding scheme is predefined.\n\n  - The testing environment is now based on Debian 9     (stretch) by default. This required some changes, in     particular, updating to FreeRADIUS 3.x (which forced us     to abandon the TNC@FHH patches and scenarios,     2fbe44bef3) and removing FIPS-enabled versions of     OpenSSL (the FIPS module only supports OpenSSL 1.0.2).\n\n  - Most test scenarios were migrated to swanctl.\n\nVersion 5.7.1\n\n  - Fixes a vulnerability in the gmp plugin triggered by     crafted certificates with RSA keys with very small     moduli. When verifying signatures with such keys, the     code patched with the fix for CVE-2018-16151\/2 caused an     integer underflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow     that results in a crash of the daemon.\n\n  - The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-17540.\n\nVersion 5.7.0\n\n  - Fixes a potential authorization bypass vulnerability in     the gmp plugin that was caused by a too lenient     verification of PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures. Several flaws     could be exploited by a Bleichenbacher-style attack to     forge signatures for low-exponent keys (i.e. with e=3).\n\n  - CVE-2018-16151 has been assigned to the problem of     accepting random bytes after the OID of the hash     function in such signatures, and CVE-2018-16152 has been     assigned to the issue of not verifying that the     parameters in the ASN.1 algorithmIdentitifer structure     is empty. Other flaws that don't lead to a vulnerability     directly (e.g. not checking for at least 8 bytes of     padding) have no separate CVE assigned.\n\n  - Dots are not allowed anymore in section names in     swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf. This mainly affects     the configuration of file loggers. If the path for such     a log file contains dots it now has to be configured in     the new path setting within the arbitrarily renamed     subsection in the filelog section.\n\n  - Sections in swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf may now     reference other sections. All settings and subsections     from such a section are inherited. This allows to     simplify configs as redundant information has only to be     specified once and may then be included in other     sections (see strongswan.conf for an example).\n\n  - The originally selected IKE config (based on the IPs and     IKE version) can now change if no matching algorithm     proposal is found. This way the order of the configs     doesn't matter that much anymore and it's easily     possible to specify separate configs for clients that     require weaker algorithms (instead of having to also add     them in other configs that might be selected).\n\n  - Support for Postquantum Preshared Keys for IKEv2     (draft-ietf-ipsecme-qr-ikev2) has been added. For an     example refer to the swanctl\/rw-cert-ppk scenario (or     with EAP, or PSK authentication).\n\n  - The new botan plugin is a wrapper around the Botan C++     crypto library. It requires a fairly recent build from     Botan's master branch (or the upcoming 2.8.0 release).\n    Thanks to Ren&eacute; Korthaus and his team from Rohde &     Schwarz Cybersecurity for the initial patch and to Jack     Lloyd for quickly adding missing functions to Botan's     FFI (C89) interface.\n\n  - Implementation of RFC 8412 'Software Inventory Message     and Attributes (SWIMA) for PA-TNC'.\n\n  - SWIMA subscription option sets CLOSE_WRITE trigger on     apt history.log file resulting in a ClientRetry PB-TNC     batch to initialize a new measurement cycle. The new     imv\/imc-swima plugins replace the previous imv\/imc-swid     plugins, which were removed.\n\n  - Added support for fuzzing the PA-TNC (RFC 5792) and     PB-TNC (RFC 5793) NEA protocols on Google's OSS-Fuzz     infrastructure.\n\n  - Support for version 2 of Intel's TPM2-TSS TGC Software     Stack. The presence of the in-kernel \/dev\/tpmrm0     resource manager is automatically detected.\n\n  - The pki tool accepts a xmppAddr otherName as a     subjectAlternativeName using the syntax --san     xmppaddr:<jid>.\n\n  - swanctl.conf supports the configuration of marks the in-     and\/or outbound SA should apply to packets after     processing on Linux. Configuring such a mark for     outbound SAs requires at least a 4.14 kernel. The     ability to set a mask and configuring a mark\/mask for     inbound SAs will be added with the upcoming 4.19 kernel.\n\n  - New options in swanctl.conf allow configuring     how\/whether DF, ECN and DS fields in the IP headers are     copied during IPsec processing. Controlling this is     currently only possible on Linux.\n\n  - The handling of sequence numbers in IKEv1 DPDs has been     improved (#2714).\n\n  - To avoid conflicts, the dhcp plugin now only uses the     DHCP server port if explicitly configured.\n\nVersion 5.6.3\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if     the openssl plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is     negotiated as PRF. This vulnerability has been     registered as CVE-2018-10811.\n\n  - Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did     not check the received length before reading a message     from the socket. Unless a group is configured, root     privileges are required to access that socket, so in the     default configuration this shouldn't be an issue. This     vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-5388.\n\n  - CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid     problems in scenarios where expired certificates are     removed from new CRLs and the clock on the host doing     the revocation check is trailing behind that of the host     issuing CRLs. Not doing this could result in accepting a     revoked and expired certificate, if it's still valid     according to the trailing clock but not contained     anymore in not yet valid CRLs.\n\n  - The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer     of the checked certificate (#2608).\n\n  - CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a     skipped check because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are     now stored also for intermediate CA certificates and not     only for end-entity certificates, so a strict CRL policy     can be enforced in such cases.\n\n  - In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2,     certificates used for IKE must now either not contain a     keyUsage extension (like the ones generated by pki), or     have at least one of the digitalSignature or     nonRepudiation bits set.\n\n  - New options for vici\/swanctl allow forcing the local     termination of an IKE_SA. This might be useful in     situations where it's known the other end is not     reachable anymore, or that it already removed the     IKE_SA, so retransmitting a DELETE and waiting for a     response would be pointless.\n\n  - Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response     (i.e. shorter than all retransmits would be) before     destroying the IKE_SA is also possible by additionally     specifying a timeout in the forced termination request.\n\n  - When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now     checks if it tracks other routes for the same     destination and replaces the installed route instead of     just removing it. Same during installation, where     existing routes previously weren't replaced. This should     allow using traps with virtual IPs on Linux (#2162).\n\n  - The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier     DHCP option if the identity_lease setting is enabled     (7b660944b6). It can also send identities of up to 255     bytes length, instead of the previous 64 bytes     (30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server address is     configured, DHCP requests are now sent from port 67     instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port unreachables     (becf027cd9).\n\n  - The handling of faulty INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g.\n    one containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during     CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges has been improved (#2536).\n\n  - Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs     (there is no MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).\n\n  - ChaCha20\/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key     length (#2614). For compatibility with older releases     the chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in     proposals to also propose the algorithm with a key     length (c58434aeff).\n\n  - Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now     more flexible and allows a new setting (auto), which     automatically uses it if the kernel and device both     support it. If hw offload is set to yes and offloading     is not supported, the CHILD_SA installation now fails.\n\n  - The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via     internal interface (one with an IP in the local traffic     selector). On FreeBSD, enabling this selects the correct     source IP when sending packets from the gateway itself     (e811659323).\n\n  - SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as     generated by OpenSSL 1.1 (#2574).\n\n  - The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs     from directories.\n\n  - The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the     remote port is not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the     response to a different port, as might happen on Azure),     as long as the local port is 500 (85bfab621d).\n\n  - Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager     in charon-nm (ee8c25516a).\n\n  - Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol     if either protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).\n\n  - Only the inbound SA\/policy will be updated as reaction     to IP address changes for rekeyed CHILD_SAs that are     kept around.\n\n  - The parser for strongswan.conf\/swanctl.conf now accepts     = characters in values without having to put the value     in quotes (e.g. for Base64 encoded shared secrets).\n\n    Notes for developers :\n\n  - trap_manager_t: Trap policies are now unistalled by     peer\/child name and not the reqid.\n\n  - No reqid is returned anymore when installing trap     policies.\n\n  - child_sa_t: A new state (CHILD_DELETED) is used for     CHILD_SAs that have been deleted but not yet destroyed     (after a rekeying CHILD_SAs are kept around for a while     to process delayed packets). This way child_updown     events are not triggered anymore for such SAs when an     IKE_SA that has such CHILD_SAs assigned is deleted.\n\nVersion 5.6.2\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1     RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient     input validation. One of the configurable parameters in     algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS     signatures is the mask generation function (MGF). Only     MGF1 is currently specified for this purpose. However,     this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the     underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not     correctly handle the case of this parameter being     absent, causing an undefined data read. This     vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.\n\n  - When rekeying IKEv2 IKE_SAs the previously negotiated DH     group will be reused, instead of using the first     configured group, which avoids an additional exchange if     the peer previously selected a different DH group via     INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify. The same is also done when     rekeying CHILD_SAs except for the first rekeying of the     CHILD_SA that was created with the IKE_SA, where no DH     group was negotiated yet. Also, the selected DH group is     moved to the front in all sent proposals that contain it     and all proposals that don't are moved to the back in     order to convey the preference for this group to the     peer.\n\n  - Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In     particular, the response to an address update (with     NAT-D payloads) is not ignored anymore if only an     address list update or DPD is queued as that could     prevent updating the UDP encapsulation in the kernel.\n\n  - On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by     changes to the routing rules, which can be useful if     routing rules (instead of e.g. route metrics) are used     to switch from one to another interface (i.e. from one     to another routing table). Since routing rules are     currently not evaluated when doing route lookups this is     only useful if the kernel-based route lookup is used     (4664992f7d).\n\n  - The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic     leaks when replacing addresses in installed policies are     now replaced by temporary drop policies, which also     prevent acquires because we currently delete and     reinstall IPsec SAs to update their addresses     (35ef1b032d).\n\n  - Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage     of a TPM 2.0 referenced via the NV index. Adding the\n    --keyid parameter to pki --print allows to print private     keys or certificates stored in a smartcard or a TPM 2.0.\n\n  - Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH     groups in the ESP proposal during IKE_AUTH and also if a     DH group is configured in the local ESP proposal and     charon.prefer configured_proposals is disabled     (d058fd3c32).\n\n  - The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved     for certain scenarios (see #2497 for details).\n\n  - MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to     avoid compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs     that have a block size < 64 bytes (e.g.\n    AES-XCBC-PRF-128, see 73cbce6013).\n\n  - The tpm_extendpcr command line tool extends a digest     into a TPM PCR.\n\n  - Ported the NetworkManager backend from the deprecated     libnm-glib to libnm.\n\n  - The save-keys debugging\/development plugin saves IKE     and\/or ESP keys to files compatible with Wireshark.\n\nVersion 5.6.1\n\n  - Several algorithms were removed from the default ESP\/AH     and IKE proposals in compliance with RFC 8221 and RFC     8247, respectively. Removed from the default ESP\/AH     proposal were the 3DES and Blowfish encryption     algorithms and the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm. From     the IKE default proposal the HMAC-MD5 integrity     algorithm and the MODP-1024 Diffie-Hellman group were     removed (the latter is significant for Windows clients     in their default configuration). These algorithms may     still be used in custom proposals.\n\n  - Support for RSASSA-PSS signatures has been added. For     compatibility with previous releases they are currently     not used automatically, by default, to change that     charon.rsa_pss may be enabled. To explicitly use or     require such signatures during IKEv2 signature     authentication (RFC 7427) ike:rsa\/pss... authentication     constraints may be used for specific connections     (regardless of whether the strongswan.conf option above     is enabled). Only the hash algorithm can be specified in     such constraints, the MGF1 will be based on that hash     and the salt length will equal the hash length (when     verifying the salt length is not enforced). To enforce     such signatures during PKI verification use rsa\/pss...\n    authentication constraints.\n\n  - All pki commands that create certificates\/CRLs can be     made to sign with RSASSA-PSS instead of the classing     PKCS#1 scheme with the --rsa-padding pss option. As with     signatures during authentication, only the hash     algorithm is configurable (via --digest option), the     MGF1 will be based on that and the salt length will     equal the hash length.\n\n  - These signatures are supported by all RSA backends     except pkcs11 (i.e. gmp, gcrypt, openssl). The gmp     plugin requires the mgf1 plugin. Note that RSASSA-PSS     algorithm identifiers and parameters in keys (public     keys in certificates or private keys in PKCS#8 files)     are currently not used as constraints.\n\n  - The sec-updater tool checks for security updates in     dpkg-based repositories (e.g. Debian\/Ubuntu) and sets     the security flags in the IMV policy database     accordingly. Additionally for each new package version a     SWID tag for the given OS and HW architecture is created     and stored in the database.\n\n  - Using the sec-updater.sh script template the lookup can     be automated (e.g. via an hourly cron job).\n\n  - When restarting an IKEv2 negotiation after receiving an     INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify (or due to other reasons like     too many retransmits) a new initiator SPI is allocated.\n    This prevents issues caused by retransmits for     IKE_SA_INIT messages.\n\n  - Because the initiator SPI was previously reused when     restarting the connection delayed responses for previous     connection attempts were processed and might have caused     fatal errors due to a failed DH negotiation or because     of the internal retry counter in the ike-init task. For     instance, if we proposed a DH group the responder     rejected we might have later received delayed responses     that either contained INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies with     the DH group we already switched to, or, if we     retransmitted an IKE_SA_INIT with the requested group     but then had to restart again, a KE payload with a group     different from the one we proposed.\n\n  - The introduction of file versions in the IMV database     scheme broke file reference hash measurements. This has     been fixed by creating generic product versions having     an empty package name.\n\n  - A new timeout option for the systime-fix plugin stops     periodic system time checks after a while and enforces a     certificate verification, closing or reauthenticating     all SAs with invalid certificates.\n\n  - The IKE event counters, previously only available via     ipsec listcounters command, may now also be queried and     reset via vici and the new swanctl --counters command.\n    They are collected and provided by the optional counters     plugin (enabled by default for backwards compatibility     if the stroke plugin is built).\n\n  - Class attributes received in RADIUS Access-Accept     messages may optionally be added to RADIUS accounting     messages (655924074b).\n\n  - Basic support for systemd sockets has been added, which     may be used for privilege separation (59db98fb94).\n\n  - Inbound marks may optionally be installed in the SA     again (was removed with 5.5.2) by enabling the     mark_in_sa option in swanctl.conf.\n\n  - The timeout of leases in pools configured via pool     utility may be configured in other units than hours.\n    INITIAL_CONTACT notifies are now only omitted if never     is configured as uniqueness policy.\n\n  - Outbound FWD policies for shunts are not installed     anymore, by default (as is the case for other policies     since 5.5.1).\n\n  - Don't consider a DH group mismatch during CHILD_SA     rekeying as failure as responder (e7276f78aa).\n\n  - Handling of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets in libipsec     has been improved (e138003de9).\n\n  - Trigger expire events for the correct IPsec SA in     libipsec (6e861947a0).\n\n  - A crash in CRL verification via openssl plugin using     OpenSSL 1.1 has been fixed (78acaba6a1).\n\n  - No hard-coded default proposals are passed from starter     to the stroke plugin anymore (the IKE proposal used     curve25519 since 5.5.2, which is an optional plugin).\n\n  - A workaround for an issue with virtual IPs on macOS     10.13 (High Sierra) has been added (039b85dd43).\n\n  - Handling of IKE_SA rekey collisions in charon-tkm has     been fixed.\n\n  - Instead of failing or just silently doing nothing unit     tests may now warn about certain conditions (e.g. if a     test was not executed due to external dependencies).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.","cvss3":[],"published":"2020-03-30T00:00:00","type":"nessus","title":"openSUSE Security Update : strongswan (openSUSE-2020-403)","bulletinFamily":"scanner","cvss2":[],"cvelist":["CVE-2018-10811","CVE-2018-16151","CVE-2018-16152","CVE-2018-17540","CVE-2018-5388","CVE-2018-6459"],"modified":"2024-03-20T00:00:00","cpe":["p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-debugsource","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-hmac","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-ipsec","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-ipsec-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-libs0","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-libs0-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-mysql","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-mysql-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-nm","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-nm-debuginfo","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-sqlite","p-cpe:\/a:novell:opensuse:strongswan-sqlite-debuginfo","cpe:\/o:novell:opensuse:15.1"],"id":"OPENSUSE-2020-403.NASL","href":"https:\/\/www.tenable.com\/plugins\/nessus\/135007","sourceData":"#\n# (C) Tenable Network Security, Inc.\n#\n# The descriptive text and package checks in this plugin were\n# extracted from openSUSE Security Update openSUSE-2020-403.\n#\n# The text description of this plugin is (C) SUSE LLC.\n#\n\ninclude('compat.inc');\n\nif (description)\n{\n  script_id(135007);\n  script_version(\"1.3\");\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"plugin_modification_date\", value:\"2024\/03\/20\");\n\n  script_cve_id(\n    \"CVE-2018-10811\",\n    \"CVE-2018-16151\",\n    \"CVE-2018-16152\",\n    \"CVE-2018-17540\",\n    \"CVE-2018-5388\",\n    \"CVE-2018-6459\"\n  );\n\n  script_name(english:\"openSUSE Security Update : strongswan (openSUSE-2020-403)\");\n\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"synopsis\", value:\n\"The remote openSUSE host is missing a security update.\");\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"description\", value:\n\"This update for strongswan fixes the following issues :\n\nStrongswan was updated to version 5.8.2 (jsc#SLE-11370).\n\nSecurity issue fixed :\n\n  - CVE-2018-6459: Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser\n    for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by\n    insufficient input validation (bsc#1079548).\n\nFull changelogs :\n\nVersion 5.8.2\n\n  - Identity-based CA constraints, which enforce that the\n    certificate chain of the remote peer contains a CA\n    certificate with a specific identity, are supported via\n    vici\/swanctl.conf. This is similar to the existing CA\n    constraints but doesn't require that the CA certificate\n    is locally installed, for instance, intermediate CA\n    certificates received from the peers.

With the new\n    constraint that's not necessary as long as a path length\n    basic constraint (--pathlen for pki --issue) prevents\n    intermediate CAs from issuing further intermediate CAs.\n\n  - Intermediate CA certificates may now be sent in\n    hash-and-URL encoding by configuring a base URL for the\n    parent CA (#3234, swanctl\/rw-hash-and-url-multi-level).\n\n  - Implemented NIST SP-800-90A Deterministic Random Bit\n    Generator (DRBG) based on AES-CTR and SHA2-HMAC modes.\n    Currently used by the gmp and ntru plugins.\n\n  - Random nonces sent in an OCSP requests are now expected\n    in the corresponding OCSP responses.\n\n  - The kernel-netlink plugin now ignores deprecated IPv6\n    addresses for MOBIKE. Whether temporary or permanent\n    IPv6 addresses are included now depends on the\n    charon.prefer_temporary_addrs setting (#3192).\n\n  - Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are configured via\n    PF_KEY if supported by the kernel.\n\n  - The PF_KEY socket's receive buffer in the kernel-pfkey\n    plugin is now cleared before sending requests, as many\n    of the messages sent by the kernel are sent as\n    broadcasts to all PF_KEY sockets. This is an issue if an\n    external tool is used to manage SAs\/policies unrelated\n    to IPsec (#3225).\n\n  - The vici plugin now uses unique section names for\n    CHILD_SAs in child-updown events (7c74ce9190).\n\n  - For individually deleted CHILD_SAs (in particular for\n    IKEv1) the vici child-updown event now includes more\n    information about the CHILD_SAs such as traffic\n    statistics (#3198).\n\n  - Custom loggers are correctly re-registered if log levels\n    are changed via stroke loglevel (#3182).\n\n  - Avoid lockups during startup on low entropy systems when\n    using OpenSSL 1.1.1 (095a2c2eac).\n\n  - Instead of failing later when setting a key, creating\n    HMACs via openssl plugin now fails instantly if the\n    underlying hash algorithm isn't supported (e.g. MD5 in\n    FIPS-mode) so fallbacks to other plugins work properly\n    (#3284).\n\n  - Exponents of RSA keys read from TPM 2.0 via SAPI are\n    correctly converted (8ee1242f1438).\n\n  - Routing table IDs > 255 are supported for custom routes\n    on Linux.\n\n  - To avoid races, the check for hardware offloading\n    support in the kernel-netlink plugin is performed during\n    initialization of the plugin (a605452c03).\n\n  - The D-Bus config file for charon-nm is now installed in\n    $(datadir)\/dbus-1\/system.d instead of\n    $(sysconfdir)\/dbus-1\/system.d, which is intended for\n    sysadmin overrides. INVALID_MAJOR_VERSION notifies are\n    now correctly sent in messages of the same exchange type\n    and with the same message ID as the request.\n\n  - IKEv2 SAs are now immediately destroyed when sending or\n    receiving INVALID_SYNTAX notifies in authenticated\n    messages.\n\n  - For developers working from the repository the configure\n    script now aborts if GNU gperf is not found.\n\nVersion 5.8.1\n\n  - RDNs in DNs of X.509 certificates can now optionally be\n    matched less strict. The global strongswan.conf option\n    charon.rdn_matching takes two alternative values that\n    cause the matching algorithm to either ignore the order\n    of matched RDNs (reordered) or additionally (relaxed)\n    accept DNs that contain more RDNs than configured\n    (unmatched RDNs are treated like wildcard matches).\n\n  - The updown plugin now passes the same interface to the\n    script that is also used for the automatically installed\n    routes, that is, the interface over which the peer is\n    reached instead of the interface on which the local\n    address is found (#3095).\n\n  - TPM 2.0 contexts are now protected by a mutex to prevent\n    issues if multiple IKE_SAs use the same private key\n    concurrently (4b25885025).\n\n  - Do a rekey check after the third QM message was received\n    (#3060).\n\n  - If available, explicit_bzero() is now used as memwipe()\n    instead of our own implementation.\n\n  - An .editorconfig file has been added, mainly so Github\n    shows files with proper indentation (68346b6962).\n\n  - The internal certificate of the load-tester plugin has\n    been modified so it can again be used as end-entity cert\n    with 5.6.3 and later (#3139).\n\n  - The maximum data length of received COOKIE notifies (64\n    bytes) is now enforced (#3160).\n\nVersion 5.8.0\n\n  - The systemd service units have been renamed. The modern\n    unit, which was called strongswan-swanctl, is now called\n    strongswan (the previous name is configured as alias in\n    the unit, for which a symlink is created when the unit\n    is enabled). The legacy unit is now called\n    strongswan-starter.\n\n  - Support for XFRM interfaces (available since Linux 4.19)\n    has been added, which are intended to replace VTI\n    devices (they are similar but offer several advantages,\n    for instance, they are not bound to an address or\n    address family).\n\n  - IPsec SAs and policies are associated with such\n    interfaces via interface IDs that can be configured in\n    swanctl.conf (dynamic IDs may optionally be allocated\n    for each SA and even direction). It's possible to use\n    separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic (or\n    only use an interface in one direction and regular\n    policies in the other).\n\n  - Interfaces may be created dynamically via updown\/vici\n    scripts, or statically before or after establishing the\n    SAs. Routes must be added manually as needed (the daemon\n    will not install any routes for outbound policies with\n    an interface ID). \n\n  - When moving XFRM interfaces to other network namespaces\n    they retain access to the SAs and policies installed in\n    the original namespace, which allows providing IPsec\n    tunnels for processes in other network namespaces\n    without giving them access to the IPsec keys or IKE\n    credentials. More information can be found on the page\n    about route-based VPNs.\n\n  - Initiation of childless IKE_SAs is supported (RFC 6023).\n    If enabled and supported by the responder, no CHILD_SA\n    is established during IKE_AUTH. Instead, all CHILD_SAs\n    are created with CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges. This allows\n    using a separate DH exchange even for the first\n    CHILD_SA, which is otherwise created during IKE_AUTH\n    with keys derived from the IKE_SA's key material.\n\n  - The swanctl --initiate command may be used to initiate\n    only the IKE_SA via --ike option if --child is omitted\n    and the peer supports this extension.\n\n  - The NetworkManager backend and plugin support IPv6.\n\n  - The new wolfssl plugin is a wrapper around the wolfSSL\n    crypto library. Thanks to Sean Parkinson of wolfSSL Inc.\n    for the initial patch.\n\n  - IKE SPIs may optionally be labeled via the\n    charon.spi_mask|label options in strongswan.conf. This\n    feature was extracted from charon-tkm, however, now\n    applies the mask\/label in network order.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 when built\n    with OpenSSL 1.1.0.\n\n  - The PB-TNC finite state machine according to section 3.2\n    of RFC 5793 was not correctly implemented when sending\n    either a CRETRY or SRETRY batch. These batches can only\n    be sent in the 'Decided' state and a CRETRY batch can\n    immediately carry all messages usually transported by a\n    CDATA batch. It is currently not possible to send a\n    SRETRY batch since full-duplex mode for PT-TLS transport\n    is not supported.\n\n  - Instead of marking IPv6 virtual IPs as deprecated, the\n    kernel-netlink plugin now uses address labels to avoid\n    that such addresses are used for non-VPN traffic\n    (00a953d090).\n\n  - The agent plugin now creates sockets to the\n    ssh\/gpg-agent dynamically and does not keep them open,\n    which otherwise might prevent the agent from getting\n    terminated.\n\n  - To avoid broadcast loops the forecast plugin now only\n    reinjects packets that are marked or received from the\n    configured interface.\n\n  - UTF-8 encoded passwords are supported via EAP-MSCHAPv2,\n    which internally uses an UTF-16LE encoding to calculate\n    the NT hash (#3014).\n\n  - Properly delete temporary drop policies (used when\n    updating IP addresses of SAs) if manual priorities are\n    used, which was broken since 5.6.2 (8e31d65730).\n\n  - Avoid overwriting start_action when parsing the\n    inactivity timeout in the vici plugin (#2954).\n\n  - Fixed the automatic termination of reloaded vici\n    connections with start_action=start, which was broken\n    since 5.6.3 (71b22c250f).\n\n  - The lookup for shared secrets for IKEv1 SAs via sql\n    plugin should now work better (6ec9f68f32).\n\n  - Fixed a race condition in the trap manager between\n    installation and removal of a policy (69cbe2ca3f).\n\n  - The IPsec stack detection and module loading in starter\n    has been removed (it wasn't enforced anyway and loading\n    modules doesn't seem necessary, also KLIPS hasn't been\n    supported for a long time and PF_KEY will eventually be\n    removed from the Linux kernel, ba817d2917).\n\n  - Several IKEv2 protocol details are now handled more\n    strictly: Unrequested virtual IPs are ignored, CFG_REPLY\n    payloads are ignored if no CFG_REQUEST payloads were\n    sent, a USE TRANSPORT_MODE notify received from the\n    responder is checked against the local configuration.\n\n  - The keys and certificates used by the scenarios in the\n    testing environment are now generated dynamically.\n    Running the testing\/scripts\/build-certs script after\n    creating the base and root images uses the pki utility\n    installed in the latter to create the keys and\n    certificates for all the CAs and in some cases for\n    individual scenarios. These credentials are stored in\n    the source tree, not the image, so this has to be called\n    only once even if the images are later rebuilt. The\n    script automatically (re-)rebuilds the guest images as\n    that generates fresh CRLs and signs the DNS zones. The\n    only keys\/certificates currently not generated are the\n    very large ones used by the ikev2\/rw-eap-tls-fragments\n    scenario. \n\nVersion 5.7.2\n\n  - For RSA with PSS padding, the TPM 2.0 specification\n    mandates the maximum salt length (as defined by the\n    length of the key and hash). However, if the TPM is\n    FIPS-168-4 compliant, the salt length equals the hash\n    length. This is assumed for FIPS-140-2 compliant TPMs,\n    but if that's not the case, it might be necessary to\n    manually enable charon.plugins.tpm.fips_186_4 if the TPM\n    doesn't use the maximum salt length.\n\n  - Directories for credentials loaded by swanctl are now\n    accessed relative to the loaded swanctl.conf file, in\n    particular, when loading it from a custom location via\n    --file argument.\n\n  - The base directory, which is used if no custom location\n    for swanctl.conf is specified, is now also configurable\n    at runtime via SWANCTL_DIR environment variable.\n\n  - If RADIUS Accounting is enabled, the eap-radius plugin\n    will add the session ID (Acct-Session-Id) to\n    Access-Request messages, which e.g. simplifies\n    associating database entries for IP leases and\n    accounting with sessions (the session ID does not change\n    when IKE_SAs are rekeyed, #2853).\n\n  - All IP addresses assigned by a RADIUS server are\n    included in Accounting-Stop messages even if the client\n    did not claim them, allowing to release them early in\n    case of connection errors (#2856).\n\n  - Selectors installed on transport mode SAs by the\n    kernel-netlink plugin are now updated if an IP address\n    changes (e.g. via MOBIKE) and it was part of the\n    selectors.\n\n  - No deletes are sent anymore when a rekeyed CHILD_SA\n    expires (#2815).\n\n  - The bypass-lan plugin now tracks interfaces to handle\n    subnets that move from one interface to another and\n    properly update associated routes (#2820).\n\n  - Only valid and expected inbound IKEv2 messages are used\n    to update the timestamp of the last received message\n    (previously, retransmits also triggered an update).\n\n  - IKEv2 requests from responders are now ignored until the\n    IKE_SA is fully established (e.g. if a DPD request from\n    the peer arrives before the IKE_AUTH response does,\n    46bea1add9). Delayed IKE_SA_INIT responses with COOKIE\n    notifies we already recevied are ignored, they caused\n    another reset of the IKE_SA previously (#2837).\n\n  - Active and queued Quick Mode tasks are now adopted if\n    the peer reauthenticates an IKEv1 SA while creating lots\n    of CHILD_SAs.\n\n  - Newer versions of the FreeBSD kernel add an\n    SADB_X_EXT_SA2 extension to SADB_ACQUIRE messages, which\n    allows the kernel-pfkey plugin to determine the reqid of\n    the policy even if it wasn't installed by the daemon\n    previously (e.g. when using FreeBSD's if_ipsec(4) VTIs,\n    which install policies themselves, 872b9b3e8d).\n\n  - Added support for RSA signatures with SHA-256 and\n    SHA-512 to the agent plugin. For older versions of\n    ssh\/gpg-agent that only support SHA-1, IKEv2 signature\n    authentication has to be disabled via\n    charon.signature_authentication.\n\n  - The sshkey and agent plugins support Ed25519\/Ed448 SSH\n    keys and signatures.\n\n  - The openssl plugin supports X25519\/X448 Diffie-Hellman\n    and Ed25519\/Ed448 keys and signatures when built against\n    OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n\n  - Support for Ed25519, ChaCha20\/Poly1305, SHA-3 and\n    AES-CCM were added to the botan plugin.\n\n  - The mysql plugin now properly handles database\n    connections with transactions under heavy load (#2779).\n\n  - IP addresses in ha pools are now distributed evenly\n    among all segments (#2828).\n\n  - Private key implementations may optionally provide a\n    list of supported signature schemes, which, as described\n    above, is used by the tpm plugin because for each key on\n    a TPM 2.0 the hash algorithm and for RSA also the\n    padding scheme is predefined.\n\n  - The testing environment is now based on Debian 9\n    (stretch) by default. This required some changes, in\n    particular, updating to FreeRADIUS 3.x (which forced us\n    to abandon the TNC@FHH patches and scenarios,\n    2fbe44bef3) and removing FIPS-enabled versions of\n    OpenSSL (the FIPS module only supports OpenSSL 1.0.2).\n\n  - Most test scenarios were migrated to swanctl.\n\nVersion 5.7.1\n\n  - Fixes a vulnerability in the gmp plugin triggered by\n    crafted certificates with RSA keys with very small\n    moduli. When verifying signatures with such keys, the\n    code patched with the fix for CVE-2018-16151\/2 caused an\n    integer underflow and subsequent heap buffer overflow\n    that results in a crash of the daemon.\n\n  - The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-17540.\n\nVersion 5.7.0\n\n  - Fixes a potential authorization bypass vulnerability in\n    the gmp plugin that was caused by a too lenient\n    verification of PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures. Several flaws\n    could be exploited by a Bleichenbacher-style attack to\n    forge signatures for low-exponent keys (i.e. with e=3).\n\n  - CVE-2018-16151 has been assigned to the problem of\n    accepting random bytes after the OID of the hash\n    function in such signatures, and CVE-2018-16152 has been\n    assigned to the issue of not verifying that the\n    parameters in the ASN.1 algorithmIdentitifer structure\n    is empty. Other flaws that don't lead to a vulnerability\n    directly (e.g. not checking for at least 8 bytes of\n    padding) have no separate CVE assigned.\n\n  - Dots are not allowed anymore in section names in\n    swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf. This mainly affects\n    the configuration of file loggers. If the path for such\n    a log file contains dots it now has to be configured in\n    the new path setting within the arbitrarily renamed\n    subsection in the filelog section.\n\n  - Sections in swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf may now\n    reference other sections. All settings and subsections\n    from such a section are inherited. This allows to\n    simplify configs as redundant information has only to be\n    specified once and may then be included in other\n    sections (see strongswan.conf for an example).\n\n  - The originally selected IKE config (based on the IPs and\n    IKE version) can now change if no matching algorithm\n    proposal is found. This way the order of the configs\n    doesn't matter that much anymore and it's easily\n    possible to specify separate configs for clients that\n    require weaker algorithms (instead of having to also add\n    them in other configs that might be selected).\n\n  - Support for Postquantum Preshared Keys for IKEv2\n    (draft-ietf-ipsecme-qr-ikev2) has been added. For an\n    example refer to the swanctl\/rw-cert-ppk scenario (or\n    with EAP, or PSK authentication).\n\n  - The new botan plugin is a wrapper around the Botan C++\n    crypto library. It requires a fairly recent build from\n    Botan's master branch (or the upcoming 2.8.0 release).\n    Thanks to Ren&eacute; Korthaus and his team from Rohde &\n    Schwarz Cybersecurity for the initial patch and to Jack\n    Lloyd for quickly adding missing functions to Botan's\n    FFI (C89) interface.\n\n  - Implementation of RFC 8412 'Software Inventory Message\n    and Attributes (SWIMA) for PA-TNC'.\n\n  - SWIMA subscription option sets CLOSE_WRITE trigger on\n    apt history.log file resulting in a ClientRetry PB-TNC\n    batch to initialize a new measurement cycle. The new\n    imv\/imc-swima plugins replace the previous imv\/imc-swid\n    plugins, which were removed.\n\n  - Added support for fuzzing the PA-TNC (RFC 5792) and\n    PB-TNC (RFC 5793) NEA protocols on Google's OSS-Fuzz\n    infrastructure.\n\n  - Support for version 2 of Intel's TPM2-TSS TGC Software\n    Stack. The presence of the in-kernel \/dev\/tpmrm0\n    resource manager is automatically detected.\n\n  - The pki tool accepts a xmppAddr otherName as a\n    subjectAlternativeName using the syntax --san\n    xmppaddr:<jid>.\n\n  - swanctl.conf supports the configuration of marks the in-\n    and\/or outbound SA should apply to packets after\n    processing on Linux. Configuring such a mark for\n    outbound SAs requires at least a 4.14 kernel. The\n    ability to set a mask and configuring a mark\/mask for\n    inbound SAs will be added with the upcoming 4.19 kernel.\n\n  - New options in swanctl.conf allow configuring\n    how\/whether DF, ECN and DS fields in the IP headers are\n    copied during IPsec processing. Controlling this is\n    currently only possible on Linux.\n\n  - The handling of sequence numbers in IKEv1 DPDs has been\n    improved (#2714).\n\n  - To avoid conflicts, the dhcp plugin now only uses the\n    DHCP server port if explicitly configured.\n\nVersion 5.6.3\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if\n    the openssl plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is\n    negotiated as PRF. This vulnerability has been\n    registered as CVE-2018-10811.\n\n  - Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did\n    not check the received length before reading a message\n    from the socket. Unless a group is configured, root\n    privileges are required to access that socket, so in the\n    default configuration this shouldn't be an issue. This\n    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-5388.\n\n  - CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid\n    problems in scenarios where expired certificates are\n    removed from new CRLs and the clock on the host doing\n    the revocation check is trailing behind that of the host\n    issuing CRLs. Not doing this could result in accepting a\n    revoked and expired certificate, if it's still valid\n    according to the trailing clock but not contained\n    anymore in not yet valid CRLs.\n\n  - The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer\n    of the checked certificate (#2608).\n\n  - CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a\n    skipped check because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are\n    now stored also for intermediate CA certificates and not\n    only for end-entity certificates, so a strict CRL policy\n    can be enforced in such cases.\n\n  - In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2,\n    certificates used for IKE must now either not contain a\n    keyUsage extension (like the ones generated by pki), or\n    have at least one of the digitalSignature or\n    nonRepudiation bits set.\n\n  - New options for vici\/swanctl allow forcing the local\n    termination of an IKE_SA. This might be useful in\n    situations where it's known the other end is not\n    reachable anymore, or that it already removed the\n    IKE_SA, so retransmitting a DELETE and waiting for a\n    response would be pointless.\n\n  - Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response\n    (i.e. shorter than all retransmits would be) before\n    destroying the IKE_SA is also possible by additionally\n    specifying a timeout in the forced termination request.\n\n  - When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now\n    checks if it tracks other routes for the same\n    destination and replaces the installed route instead of\n    just removing it. Same during installation, where\n    existing routes previously weren't replaced. This should\n    allow using traps with virtual IPs on Linux (#2162).\n\n  - The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier\n    DHCP option if the identity_lease setting is enabled\n    (7b660944b6). It can also send identities of up to 255\n    bytes length, instead of the previous 64 bytes\n    (30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server address is\n    configured, DHCP requests are now sent from port 67\n    instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port unreachables\n    (becf027cd9).\n\n  - The handling of faulty INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g.\n    one containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during\n    CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges has been improved (#2536).\n\n  - Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs\n    (there is no MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).\n\n  - ChaCha20\/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key\n    length (#2614). For compatibility with older releases\n    the chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in\n    proposals to also propose the algorithm with a key\n    length (c58434aeff).\n\n  - Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now\n    more flexible and allows a new setting (auto), which\n    automatically uses it if the kernel and device both\n    support it. If hw offload is set to yes and offloading\n    is not supported, the CHILD_SA installation now fails.\n\n  - The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via\n    internal interface (one with an IP in the local traffic\n    selector). On FreeBSD, enabling this selects the correct\n    source IP when sending packets from the gateway itself\n    (e811659323).\n\n  - SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as\n    generated by OpenSSL 1.1 (#2574).\n\n  - The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs\n    from directories.\n\n  - The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the\n    remote port is not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the\n    response to a different port, as might happen on Azure),\n    as long as the local port is 500 (85bfab621d).\n\n  - Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager\n    in charon-nm (ee8c25516a).\n\n  - Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol\n    if either protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).\n\n  - Only the inbound SA\/policy will be updated as reaction\n    to IP address changes for rekeyed CHILD_SAs that are\n    kept around.\n\n  - The parser for strongswan.conf\/swanctl.conf now accepts\n    = characters in values without having to put the value\n    in quotes (e.g. for Base64 encoded shared secrets).\n\n    Notes for developers :\n\n  - trap_manager_t: Trap policies are now unistalled by\n    peer\/child name and not the reqid.\n\n  - No reqid is returned anymore when installing trap\n    policies.\n\n  - child_sa_t: A new state (CHILD_DELETED) is used for\n    CHILD_SAs that have been deleted but not yet destroyed\n    (after a rekeying CHILD_SAs are kept around for a while\n    to process delayed packets). This way child_updown\n    events are not triggered anymore for such SAs when an\n    IKE_SA that has such CHILD_SAs assigned is deleted.\n\nVersion 5.6.2\n\n  - Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1\n    RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient\n    input validation. One of the configurable parameters in\n    algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS\n    signatures is the mask generation function (MGF). Only\n    MGF1 is currently specified for this purpose. However,\n    this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the\n    underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not\n    correctly handle the case of this parameter being\n    absent, causing an undefined data read. This\n    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.\n\n  - When rekeying IKEv2 IKE_SAs the previously negotiated DH\n    group will be reused, instead of using the first\n    configured group, which avoids an additional exchange if\n    the peer previously selected a different DH group via\n    INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify. The same is also done when\n    rekeying CHILD_SAs except for the first rekeying of the\n    CHILD_SA that was created with the IKE_SA, where no DH\n    group was negotiated yet. Also, the selected DH group is\n    moved to the front in all sent proposals that contain it\n    and all proposals that don't are moved to the back in\n    order to convey the preference for this group to the\n    peer.\n\n  - Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In\n    particular, the response to an address update (with\n    NAT-D payloads) is not ignored anymore if only an\n    address list update or DPD is queued as that could\n    prevent updating the UDP encapsulation in the kernel.\n\n  - On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by\n    changes to the routing rules, which can be useful if\n    routing rules (instead of e.g. route metrics) are used\n    to switch from one to another interface (i.e. from one\n    to another routing table). Since routing rules are\n    currently not evaluated when doing route lookups this is\n    only useful if the kernel-based route lookup is used\n    (4664992f7d).\n\n  - The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic\n    leaks when replacing addresses in installed policies are\n    now replaced by temporary drop policies, which also\n    prevent acquires because we currently delete and\n    reinstall IPsec SAs to update their addresses\n    (35ef1b032d).\n\n  - Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage\n    of a TPM 2.0 referenced via the NV index. Adding the\n    --keyid parameter to pki --print allows to print private\n    keys or certificates stored in a smartcard or a TPM 2.0.\n\n  - Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH\n    groups in the ESP proposal during IKE_AUTH and also if a\n    DH group is configured in the local ESP proposal and\n    charon.prefer configured_proposals is disabled\n    (d058fd3c32).\n\n  - The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved\n    for certain scenarios (see #2497 for details).\n\n  - MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to\n    avoid compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs\n    that have a block size < 64 bytes (e.g.\n    AES-XCBC-PRF-128, see 73cbce6013).\n\n  - The tpm_extendpcr command line tool extends a digest\n    into a TPM PCR.\n\n  - Ported the NetworkManager backend from the deprecated\n    libnm-glib to libnm.\n\n  - The save-keys debugging\/development plugin saves IKE\n    and\/or ESP keys to files compatible with Wireshark.\n\nVersion 5.6.1\n\n  - Several algorithms were removed from the default ESP\/AH\n    and IKE proposals in compliance with RFC 8221 and RFC\n    8247, respectively. Removed from the default ESP\/AH\n    proposal were the 3DES and Blowfish encryption\n    algorithms and the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm. From\n    the IKE default proposal the HMAC-MD5 integrity\n    algorithm and the MODP-1024 Diffie-Hellman group were\n    removed (the latter is significant for Windows clients\n    in their default configuration). These algorithms may\n    still be used in custom proposals.\n\n  - Support for RSASSA-PSS signatures has been added. For\n    compatibility with previous releases they are currently\n    not used automatically, by default, to change that\n    charon.rsa_pss may be enabled. To explicitly use or\n    require such signatures during IKEv2 signature\n    authentication (RFC 7427) ike:rsa\/pss... authentication\n    constraints may be used for specific connections\n    (regardless of whether the strongswan.conf option above\n    is enabled). Only the hash algorithm can be specified in\n    such constraints, the MGF1 will be based on that hash\n    and the salt length will equal the hash length (when\n    verifying the salt length is not enforced). To enforce\n    such signatures during PKI verification use rsa\/pss...\n    authentication constraints.\n\n  - All pki commands that create certificates\/CRLs can be\n    made to sign with RSASSA-PSS instead of the classing\n    PKCS#1 scheme with the --rsa-padding pss option. As with\n    signatures during authentication, only the hash\n    algorithm is configurable (via --digest option), the\n    MGF1 will be based on that and the salt length will\n    equal the hash length.\n\n  - These signatures are supported by all RSA backends\n    except pkcs11 (i.e. gmp, gcrypt, openssl). The gmp\n    plugin requires the mgf1 plugin. Note that RSASSA-PSS\n    algorithm identifiers and parameters in keys (public\n    keys in certificates or private keys in PKCS#8 files)\n    are currently not used as constraints.\n\n  - The sec-updater tool checks for security updates in\n    dpkg-based repositories (e.g. Debian\/Ubuntu) and sets\n    the security flags in the IMV policy database\n    accordingly. Additionally for each new package version a\n    SWID tag for the given OS and HW architecture is created\n    and stored in the database.\n\n  - Using the sec-updater.sh script template the lookup can\n    be automated (e.g. via an hourly cron job).\n\n  - When restarting an IKEv2 negotiation after receiving an\n    INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify (or due to other reasons like\n    too many retransmits) a new initiator SPI is allocated.\n    This prevents issues caused by retransmits for\n    IKE_SA_INIT messages.\n\n  - Because the initiator SPI was previously reused when\n    restarting the connection delayed responses for previous\n    connection attempts were processed and might have caused\n    fatal errors due to a failed DH negotiation or because\n    of the internal retry counter in the ike-init task. For\n    instance, if we proposed a DH group the responder\n    rejected we might have later received delayed responses\n    that either contained INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies with\n    the DH group we already switched to, or, if we\n    retransmitted an IKE_SA_INIT with the requested group\n    but then had to restart again, a KE payload with a group\n    different from the one we proposed.\n\n  - The introduction of file versions in the IMV database\n    scheme broke file reference hash measurements. This has\n    been fixed by creating generic product versions having\n    an empty package name.\n\n  - A new timeout option for the systime-fix plugin stops\n    periodic system time checks after a while and enforces a\n    certificate verification, closing or reauthenticating\n    all SAs with invalid certificates.\n\n  - The IKE event counters, previously only available via\n    ipsec listcounters command, may now also be queried and\n    reset via vici and the new swanctl --counters command.\n    They are collected and provided by the optional counters\n    plugin (enabled by default for backwards compatibility\n    if the stroke plugin is built).\n\n  - Class attributes received in RADIUS Access-Accept\n    messages may optionally be added to RADIUS accounting\n    messages (655924074b).\n\n  - Basic support for systemd sockets has been added, which\n    may be used for privilege separation (59db98fb94).\n\n  - Inbound marks may optionally be installed in the SA\n    again (was removed with 5.5.2) by enabling the\n    mark_in_sa option in swanctl.conf.\n\n  - The timeout of leases in pools configured via pool\n    utility may be configured in other units than hours.\n    INITIAL_CONTACT notifies are now only omitted if never\n    is configured as uniqueness policy.\n\n  - Outbound FWD policies for shunts are not installed\n    anymore, by default (as is the case for other policies\n    since 5.5.1).\n\n  - Don't consider a DH group mismatch during CHILD_SA\n    rekeying as failure as responder (e7276f78aa).\n\n  - Handling of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets in libipsec\n    has been improved (e138003de9).\n\n  - Trigger expire events for the correct IPsec SA in\n    libipsec (6e861947a0).\n\n  - A crash in CRL verification via openssl plugin using\n    OpenSSL 1.1 has been fixed (78acaba6a1).\n\n  - No hard-coded default proposals are passed from starter\n    to the stroke plugin anymore (the IKE proposal used\n    curve25519 since 5.5.2, which is an optional plugin).\n\n  - A workaround for an issue with virtual IPs on macOS\n    10.13 (High Sierra) has been added (039b85dd43).\n\n  - Handling of IKE_SA rekey collisions in charon-tkm has\n    been fixed.\n\n  - Instead of failing or just silently doing nothing unit\n    tests may now warn about certain conditions (e.g. if a\n    test was not executed due to external dependencies).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.\");\n  script_set_attribute(attribute:\"see_also\",
